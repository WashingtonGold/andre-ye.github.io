## 1.3: Life Processes Information and Requires Energy
### Introduction
- Sutton and Boveri proposed the **chromosome theory of inheritance.**
- Key point: **hereditary and/or genetic information is encoded in units called genes that are located on chromosomes** in cells. 
- Moleculular nature of genetic material later found.
- Chromosome consists of a molecule of DNA.

### The Central Dogma
- 1953 James Watson and Francis Crick proved DNA was a double-stranded helix.
- Each strand of a double helix is made up of four molecular building blocks.
- DNA carries, or encodes, information required for organism growth and reproduction.
- Base pairing allows DNA to be copied and preserves information encoded inside it.

<br>

- **The centrla dogma** describes the flow of information in cells.
- Dogma means a framework for understanding.
- DNA codes for RNA, which codes for proteins.

<br>

- Cells make a copy of a particular gene's infromation in the form of RNA, which carries out specialized functions in cells.
- Cell reads messenger RNA to determine what blocks to use to make a protein.
- Structure of DNA provided insight into genetic information passed when cells replicate.

<br>

- Mistakes in copying DNA leads to differences in sequences of building blocks in proteins.
- Outward appearance is a product of proteins, so DNA sequence difference may lead to differences in finch beak size and shape or length of a giraffe's neck.
- Heritable variations underlie the diversity of life.

### Life Requires Energy
- The chemical reactions that sustain life take place inside cells.
- Transmitting genetic information requires energy.
- Organisms are capable of living in many environments because they *vary in cell structure and in how they acquire and use energy.*

<br>

- Organisms need two things:
  - Chemical energy in the form of ATP
  - Moelcules that can be used as building blocks for synthesis of DNA, RNA, proteins, cell membrane, and other compounds.
- How do organisms obtain these materials?

<br>

- Plants and bacteria produce sugar using energy from sunlight.
- Use sugar to make ATP or store in other energy-rich molecules.
- Plants that are eaten or decomposed have their energy molecules obtained by animals, fungi, archaea, or othe rbacteria.
- **Crucial:** how do organisms secure food?
  - Vastly different methods of doing so.

<br>

- Cells in a multicellular organism are connected by common lineage.
- Third great founding idea in biology was that all distinct identifiable type sof organisms are connected by a common ancestry.
