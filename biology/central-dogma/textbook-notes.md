## 1.3: Life Processes Information and Requires Energy
### Introduction
- Sutton and Boveri proposed the **chromosome theory of inheritance.**
- Key point: **hereditary and/or genetic information is encoded in units called genes that are located on chromosomes** in cells. 
- Moleculular nature of genetic material later found.
- Chromosome consists of a molecule of DNA.

### The Central Dogma
- 1953 James Watson and Francis Crick proved DNA was a double-stranded helix.
- Each strand of a double helix is made up of four molecular building blocks.
- DNA carries, or encodes, information required for organism growth and reproduction.
- Base pairing allows DNA to be copied and preserves information encoded inside it.

<br>

- **The centrla dogma** describes the flow of information in cells.
- Dogma means a framework for understanding.
- DNA codes for RNA, which codes for proteins.

<br>

- Cells make a copy of a particular gene's infromation in the form of RNA, which carries out specialized functions in cells.
- Cell reads messenger RNA to determine what blocks to use to make a protein.
- Structure of DNA provided insight into genetic information passed when cells replicate.

<br>

- Mistakes in copying DNA leads to differences in sequences of building blocks in proteins.
- Outward appearance is a product of proteins, so DNA sequence difference may lead to differences in finch beak size and shape or length of a giraffe's neck.
- Heritable variations underlie the diversity of life.

### Life Requires Energy
- The chemical reactions that sustain life take place inside cells.
- Transmitting genetic information requires energy.
- Organisms are capable of living in many environments because they *vary in cell structure and in how they acquire and use energy.*

<br>

- Organisms need two things:
  - Chemical energy in the form of ATP
  - Moelcules that can be used as building blocks for synthesis of DNA, RNA, proteins, cell membrane, and other compounds.
- How do organisms obtain these materials?

<br>

- Plants and bacteria produce sugar using energy from sunlight.
- Use sugar to make ATP or store in other energy-rich molecules.
- Plants that are eaten or decomposed have their energy molecules obtained by animals, fungi, archaea, or othe rbacteria.
- **Crucial:** how do organisms secure food?
  - Vastly different methods of doing so.

<br>

- Cells in a multicellular organism are connected by common lineage.
- Third great founding idea in biology was that all distinct identifiable type sof organisms are connected by a common ancestry.

## 15: DNA and the Gene: Synthesis and Repair
- DNA replication and repairing to preserve genetic information
  - 15.1 What are genes made of?
  - 15.2 DNA synthesis and early hypotheses
  - 15.3 Steps in replication - models for faithful DNA synthesis
- How can genes be copied and faithfully passed to offspring?

## 15.1: What Are Genes Made Of?
- Chromosome theory of inheritance proposed that chromosomes contain genes.
  - Biologists had known since the late 1800s that chromosomes in living cells were full of DNA and proteins.
- What are genes made of? - DNA or protein?

### Initial Biological Hypothesis That Genes Were Made of Proteins
- Initially, biologists believed genes were made of proteins.
- Limitless variation in structure and function, proteins seemed suited to contain information to program a cell.
- DNA was known to contain only 4 types of DNA building blocks.
- Early incorrect model of DNA suggests it wasa a monotonous and repetitive molecule.
  - Seemed impossible to hold complex information.

### The Herschey-Chase Experiment
- In 1952, Alfred hershey and Martha Chase took up the question.
- 8 years before the study, Oswald Avery et al. used bacterial cells to show DNA *could* serve as a genetic material.
- Herschey & Chase studied how a virus called T2 infects and replicates within bacterium *Escherichia coli* (inhabitant of human gut).
  - *E. coli* was tiny and grows quickly in the laboratory.
  - Was the favored model organism in studies of biochemistry.
- Herschey & Chase knew that T2 contained only DNA and proteins.
  - Somehow genes from the virus made their way to infected bacterial cells.
- After conducting experiments, Herschey & Chase came to a model of how T2 infects bacterial cells and replicates.
  - Exterior protein coat (*capsid*) of virus left behind on the exterior of the host cell.
- Strategy for determining composition of viral substance based on two facts:
  1. T2 proteins contain sulfur, but not phosphorus.
  2. DNA contains phosphorus, but not sulfur.
- Researchers grew viruses in presence of either radioactive isotop of sulfur or radioactive isotope of phosphorus.
  - Isotopes were incorporated into proteins and DNA.
  - Produced viruses with radioactive proteins and a population with radioactive DNA.
- Herschey & Chase allwoed radioactive viruses to infect *E. coli* cells.
  - If genes consisted of DNA, only genes would be injected in the cell, and radiactive protein would be only found on capsids and radioactive DNA would be found inside the cells.
- Herschey & Chase sheared capsids off cells by agitating cultures.
  - When samples were spun in a centrifuge, small virus capsids remained in the solution; larger cells formed a pellet at the bottom of the centrifuge.
- Biologists found that all radioactive protein was outside the cells; DNA was inside the host cells.
  - Newly created virus particles contained radioactive DNA *but not radioactive protein.*
  - The DNA component must represent the virus's genes.

#### Experiment in Step-by-Step Tabular Form

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Question | Do viral genes consist of DNA or protein? |
| DNA Hypothesis | T2 virus genes consist of DNA. |
| Protein Hypothesis | T2 virus genes consist of protein. |
| Experimental Setup | Label viruses (grow one set of TS w/ radioactive DNA and radioactive protein). Infect bacteria. Agitate cultures. Centrifuge solutions and force cells into pellet. Record location of radioactive labels. |
| Prediction of DNA Hypothesis | Radioactive DNA will be located within the pellet. |
| Prediction of Protein Hypothesis | Radioactive protein will be located within the pellet. |
| Results | Radioactive DNA is in pellet. Radioactive protein is in solution. |
| Conclusion | T2 virus genes consist of DNA. |

### The Structure of DNA
- Watson and Crick proposed a model for the structure of DNA one year after Herschey and Chase's results.
- DNA is double-stranded; each polymer strand is made of monomers.
- Deoxyribonucleotides link together to form a polymer through a phosphodiester linkage or bond.
- DNA has two features; a backbone and a series of bases that project from the backbone.
- Each molecule has *difference 3' and 5' ends*.
- Lined these two strands up in opposite directions in antiparallel fashion.

## 15.2: Testing Early Hypotheses About DNA Synthesis
- A-T and G-C pairing rules suggest a way for DNA to be copied when chomosomes are replicated.
- Proposed that existing strands of DNA served as a template for production.

### Three Alternative Hypotheses
- Biologists proposed some alternatives about DNA replication:

Hypothesis | Description
--- | ---
Semiconservative replication | If parental strands of DNA separate, each could be used as a synthesis of a new daughter strand. Each daughter DNA molecule consists of one old strand and one new strand. Conserves only one of the strands.
Conservative replication | If bases of strands turned out from the helix, they could serve as a template for an entirely new double helix all at once.
Dispersive replication | Parental double helix was fragmented into small pieces before replication, and each piece was replicated either with conservative or semiconservative mechanisms. Fragments would be joined into two molecules that contained a mixture of parental and daughter strands.

### The Meselson-Stahl Experiment
- Worked with *Escherichia coli* (*E. coli*) (same bacterium used in Hershey & Chase)
- Bacterial cells copy their entire complement of DNA (genome) before every cell division.
- Distinguish parent strands from daughter strands: plan to grow *E. coli* cells in the presence of nitrogen isotopes of different masses.
  - Different nitrogen isotope available in growth as DNA synthesized; the parental & daughter strands will have different identies.
  - Density-gradient centrifugation separates molecules based on their density. [^1]
  - Double stranded DNA molecules are subjected to density-gradient centrifugation; DNA that contains heavier isotopes of nitrogen will form a band lower in the tube.
- DNA containing nitrogen isotope-14 and nitrogne isotope-15 could be sseparated into two bands.
- Grew *E. coli* cells with nutrients containing only `15_N` (nitrogen isotope 15); purified DNA and transferred culture to growth medium with `14_N`.
- After enough time, cells divided (DNA copied). Culture divided again; sample was removed and DNA was isolated.
- Concluded that conservative replication and dispersive replication was wrong. 

#### Experiment in Step-by-Step Tabular Form

| Aspect | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Question | Is replication semiconservative, conservative, or dispersive? |
| Hypothesis 1 | Replication is conservative. |
| Hypothesis 2 | Replication is semiconservative. |
| Hypothesis 3 | Replication is dispersive. |
| Experimental Setup | Grow *E. coli* cells in medium with `15_N`. Transfer cells to medium with `14_N`. Let the cells divide twice (total 3 generations). Centrifuge the three samples separately. Compare locations of DNA bands.
| Prediction 1 | After two generations: 1/2 low-density DNA, 1/2 intermediate-density DNA. |
| Prediction 2 | 1/4 high-density DNA, 3/4 low-density DNA. |
| Prediction 3 | All intermediate-density DNA. |
| Results | After 2 generations, 1/2 low-density DNA and 1/2 intermediate-density DNA. |
| Conclusion | Replication is semiconservative. |

## 15.3: A Model for DNA Synthesis
- DNA inside a cell is like an ancient cell.
- Ancient tests contain messages thousands of years old; DNA in cells has been copied and passed down from LUCA.

### DNA Polymerase
- DNA replication breakthrough: discovery of DNA polymerase.
  - Polymerizes deoxyribonucleotide monomers into DNA.
  - Is a protein that catalyzes DNA synthesis.
  - Many different types of DNA polymerase.
- DNA polymerase only works in one direction; only adds deoxyribonucleotides to the 3' end of the chain.
  - DNA synthesis goes from 5' to 3'.

#### Endergonic Polymerization Reactions
- Polymerization reactions are usually endergonic (require input of energy).
- DNA synthesis requires an input of energy, but potential energy of deoxyribonucleotide monomers is raiased by reactions tha add two phosphate groups, forming **deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs)**.
  - *n* represents any of 4 bases found in DNA.
  - dNTP has high potential energy; forms phosphodiester bonds in DNA strand.

### Where Does Replication Start?
- Biologists used electron microscopy to catch DNA replication in action.
- Replication bubble forms as DNA is synthesized.
  - Forms at sequence of bases called *origin of replication.*
- Bacterial chromosomes have only one origin of replication. Eukaryotes have multiple origins of replication.
- **Replication fork** is a Y-shaped region where parental DNA double helix is separated into strands and copied.
- DNA synthesis occurs in two directions at once.

### How is the Helix Opened and Stabilized?
- Proteins converge at an origin of replication in bacteria and eukaryotes.
- However, organisms use different ways to control DNA synthesis.

| Type | Process |
| --- | --- |
| Bacteria | Set of proteins recognizes origin of chromosome; strands near origin are separated. DNA helicase (enzyme) binds to one of the single strands of DNA near the forks. |
| Eukaryotes | Proteins that initiate DNA replication are held tight by cell-cyle regulatory proteins. DNA helicase is loaded onto double-stranded DNA at the origin. |
| All organisms | DNA helicase uses energy of ATP hydrolysis (breakdown) to separate strands of DNA at replication forks. **Single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (SSBPs)** attach to strands to prevent them from becoming double helices again. |

- Topoisomerase is an enzyme that cuts DNA, allows it to unwind, and rejoins it.
- Acts as DNA replication works ahead of the advancing replication fork to relieve twists generatd by DNA helicase.

### How is the Leading Strand Synthesized?
1. **DNA is opened, unwound, and primed.**
  - Primase synthesizes the RNA primer. 
  - Topoisomerase relieves twisting forces.
  - Helicase opens double helix.
  - SSBPs stabilize large strands.
2. Synthesis of leading strand begins. 
  - Sliding clamp holds DNA polymerase in place.
  - DNA polymerase synthesizes leading strand in 5' to 3' direction.

- Consequences of anti-parallel nature of DNA strands and limitations of DNA polymerases.
  1. DNA polymerase can synthesize DNA only in 5' to 3' direction.
  2. DNA polymerase cannot start synthesizing from scratch on a template strand.
    - Can only extend fromt he 3' of an existing strand that is hydrogen-bonded to the template.
- 3' end supplied by a strand of RNA called a **primer** that is base paired to the DNA template.
  - Primase is a RNA polymerase (enzymes that catalyze polymerization of ribonucleotides into RNA).
  - RNA polymerase can start synthesis from scratch.
- Primer laid down on single-stranded template.
  - DNA polymerase adds deoxyribonucleotides in the 5' to 3' direction.
  - A protein ring encircles DNA and binds to DNA polymerase.
  - Sliding clamp keeps DNA polymerase from falling off the DNA during synthesis.
- **Antiparallel orientation of DNA** is significant.
  - Strand of DNA synthesizes towards replication fork called **leading strand** (or **continuous strand**), because its synthesis proceeds continuously  in the direction of the moving replication fork.
- After RNA primer is in place, DNA polymerase moves along reading the template and adding deoxyribonucleotides one by one to the extending 3' end of the strand.

### How is the Lagging Strand Synthesized?
- Lagging strand (discontinuous strand) is synthesized in the direction away from the replication fork.
