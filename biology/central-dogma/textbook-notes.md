## 1.3: Life Processes Information and Requires Energy
### Introduction
- Sutton and Boveri proposed the **chromosome theory of inheritance.**
- Key point: **hereditary and/or genetic information is encoded in units called genes that are located on chromosomes** in cells. 
- Moleculular nature of genetic material later found.
- Chromosome consists of a molecule of DNA.

### The Central Dogma
- 1953 James Watson and Francis Crick proved DNA was a double-stranded helix.
- Each strand of a double helix is made up of four molecular building blocks.
- DNA carries, or encodes, information required for organism growth and reproduction.
- Base pairing allows DNA to be copied and preserves information encoded inside it.

<br>

- **The centrla dogma** describes the flow of information in cells.
- Dogma means a framework for understanding.
- DNA codes for RNA, which codes for proteins.

<br>

- Cells make a copy of a particular gene's infromation in the form of RNA, which carries out specialized functions in cells.
- Cell reads messenger RNA to determine what blocks to use to make a protein.
- Structure of DNA provided insight into genetic information passed when cells replicate.

<br>

- Mistakes in copying DNA leads to differences in sequences of building blocks in proteins.
- Outward appearance is a product of proteins, so DNA sequence difference may lead to differences in finch beak size and shape or length of a giraffe's neck.
- Heritable variations underlie the diversity of life.

### Life Requires Energy
- The chemical reactions that sustain life take place inside cells.
- Transmitting genetic information requires energy.
- Organisms are capable of living in many environments because they *vary in cell structure and in how they acquire and use energy.*

<br>

- Organisms need two things:
  - Chemical energy in the form of ATP
  - Moelcules that can be used as building blocks for synthesis of DNA, RNA, proteins, cell membrane, and other compounds.
- How do organisms obtain these materials?

<br>

- Plants and bacteria produce sugar using energy from sunlight.
- Use sugar to make ATP or store in other energy-rich molecules.
- Plants that are eaten or decomposed have their energy molecules obtained by animals, fungi, archaea, or othe rbacteria.
- **Crucial:** how do organisms secure food?
  - Vastly different methods of doing so.

<br>

- Cells in a multicellular organism are connected by common lineage.
- Third great founding idea in biology was that all distinct identifiable type sof organisms are connected by a common ancestry.

## 15: DNA and the Gene: Synthesis and Repair
- DNA replication and repairing to preserve genetic information
  - 15.1 What are genes made of?
  - 15.2 DNA synthesis and early hypotheses
  - 15.3 Steps in replication - models for faithful DNA synthesis
- How can genes be copied and faithfully passed to offspring?

## 15.1: What Are Genes Made Of?
- Chromosome theory of inheritance proposed that chromosomes contain genes.
  - Biologists had known since the late 1800s that chromosomes in living cells were full of DNA and proteins.
- What are genes made of? - DNA or protein?

### Initial Biological Hypothesis That Genes Were Made of Proteins
- Initially, biologists believed genes were made of proteins.
- Limitless variation in structure and function, proteins seemed suited to contain information to program a cell.
- DNA was known to contain only 4 types of DNA building blocks.
- Early incorrect model of DNA suggests it wasa a monotonous and repetitive molecule.
  - Seemed impossible to hold complex information.

### The Herschey-Chase Experiment
- In 1952, Alfred hershey and Martha Chase took up the question.
- 8 years before the study, Oswald Avery et al. used bacterial cells to show DNA *could* serve as a genetic material.
- Herschey & Chase studied how a virus called T2 infects and replicates within bacterium *Escherichia coli* (inhabitant of human gut).
  - *E. coli* was tiny and grows quickly in the laboratory.
  - Was the favored model organism in studies of biochemistry.
- Herschey & Chase knew that T2 contained only DNA and proteins.
  - Somehow genes from the virus made their way to infected bacterial cells.
- After conducting experiments, Herschey & Chase came to a model of how T2 infects bacterial cells and replicates.
  - Exterior protein coat (*capsid*) of virus left behind on the exterior of the host cell.
- Strategy for determining composition of viral substance based on two facts:
  1. T2 proteins contain sulfur, but not phosphorus.
  2. DNA contains phosphorus, but not sulfur.
- Researchers grew viruses in presence of either radioactive isotop of sulfur or radioactive isotope of phosphorus.
  - Isotopes were incorporated into proteins and DNA.
  - Produced viruses with radioactive proteins and a population with radioactive DNA.
- Herschey & Chase allwoed radioactive viruses to infect *E. coli* cells.
  - If genes consisted of DNA, only genes would be injected in the cell, and radiactive protein would be only found on capsids and radioactive DNA would be found inside the cells.
- Herschey & Chase sheared capsids off cells by agitating cultures.
  - When samples were spun in a centrifuge, small virus capsids remained in the solution; larger cells formed a pellet at the bottom of the centrifuge.
- Biologists found that all radioactive protein was outside the cells; DNA was inside the host cells.
  - Newly created virus particles contained radioactive DNA *but not radioactive protein.*
  - The DNA component must represent the virus's genes.

#### Experiment in Step-by-Step Tabular Form

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Question | Do viral genes consist of DNA or protein? |
| DNA Hypothesis | T2 virus genes consist of DNA. |
| Protein Hypothesis | T2 virus genes consist of protein. |
| Experimental Setup | Label viruses (grow one set of TS w/ radioactive DNA and radioactive protein). Infect bacteria. Agitate cultures. Centrifuge solutions and force cells into pellet. Record location of radioactive labels. |
| Prediction of DNA Hypothesis | Radioactive DNA will be located within the pellet. |
| Prediction of Protein Hypothesis | Radioactive protein will be located within the pellet. |
| Results | Radioactive DNA is in pellet. Radioactive protein is in solution. |
| Conclusion | T2 virus genes consist of DNA. |

### The Structure of DNA
- Watson and Crick proposed a model for the structure of DNA one year after Herschey and Chase's results.
- DNA is double-stranded; each polymer strand is made of monomers.
- Deoxyribonucleotides link together to form a polymer through a phosphodiester linkage or bond.
- DNA has two features; a backbone and a series of bases that project from the backbone.
- Each molecule has *difference 3' and 5' ends*.
- Lined these two strands up in opposite directions in antiparallel fashion.
