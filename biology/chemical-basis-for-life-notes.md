### 2.1: Atoms, Ions, and Molecules: The Building Blocks of Chemical Evolution

#### Introduction
- Four types of atoms - hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen (H, C, N, O) make up about 96% of all matter.
- Fundamental questions to understanding how simple substances evolved into complex molecules found in living cells:
    1. What is the physical structure of H, C, N, O atoms?
    2. What are the structures of simple molecules (water, CO2, etc.) that serve as building blocks of chemical evolution?
- Key theme in biology: **structure affects function**.


#### Atoms, Protons, and Neutrons
- An `atom` is the smallest identifiable unit of matter.
    - Contains a characteristic number of protons, called its `atomic number`. This is written at bottom left of the symbol.
    - Sum of protons and neutrons in atom is called `mass number` and is written at top left of symbol.
- Simple way of depicting an atom: _extremely small particles called electrons orbit an `atomic nucleus` made up of larger particles called protons and neutrons_.
    - Every element except hydrogen has one or more neutrons in its nucleus.
    - `Protons` have a positive electric charge (-1), `neutrons` are electrically neutral, and `electrons` have a negative electric charge (-1).
    - Number of protons and electrons in an atom are the same: _atom is electrically neutral_.

#### Elements and Daltons
- `Element` - a substance that consists entirely of a single type of atom.
- `Dalton (Da)` is used to measure the masses of electrons, etc. Masses of protons and neutrons are about 1 Da. An electron's mass is so small it is *usually ignored*.
- The number of protons in an element does not change; if the atomic number in an atom changes, it is no longer the same element.
 
#### Isotopes
- The number of neutrons *can vary*. **Forms of an element with different numbers of neutrons are `isotopes`**. 
    - Isotopes of the same element can have different masses because they have different numbers of neutrons. 
    - `Atomic weight` of an element is the average of all masses of naturally occuring isotopes in nature. This is why atomic weight can be slightly different from mass number.
    - Some isotopes are not stable; these are `radioactive isotopes`. The nucleus will decay and release energy in the form of radiation.


#### Structure of Atoms
- The arrangement of electrons around the nucleus helps us understand how different elements behave.
- Electrons move around the atomic nucleus in regions called `orbitals`. An orbital can hold up to two electrons (a pair).
- Orbitals are grouped into levels called `electron shells`. These are numbered 1, 2, 3, ... to indicate how close to how far the levels are from the nucleus.
- An electron shell contains a specific number of orbitals. Each orbital in a shell is loaded with at least one electron before any orbital can be filled with a second paired electron. Electrons in an atom must also be filled from innermost to outermost.
- The outermost shell of the element is called the `valence shell`. Electrons in this shell are `valence electrons`. 
    - The number of unpaired electrons in the atom's valence shell is its `valence`.

#### Bonds
- A `covalent bond` is when two atoms share electrons, and the connected atoms form a `molecule`.
    - Covalent bonds can make atoms more stable (e.g. when the valence shell is not filled with only one electron, but together the valence shell is filled). **Shared electrons 'glue' atoms together into molecules**.
    - The two bonded atoms are written as H-H or H2.


- Electrons participating in a covalent bond are not always shared equally in the atoms involved. This can heppn in `compounds`, where atoms of different elements are bonded together.
- When atoms of different elements bond, they may pull electrons towards their nuclei with different strengths; this is called `electronegativity`.
    - Electronegativity is caused by the number of protons in the nucleus and the distance between the nucleus and the valence shell.
    - E.g. like a magnet; **electronegativity is caused by the strength of the 'magnet' *and* how far away the object is from it.**
    - Electronegativities of six most abundant elements in organisms: O > N > S = C = H = P (= being approximate).
- A bond that involves equally shared electrons is a `nonpolar covalent bond`.
- A bond that involves assymetrically shared electrons is a `polar covalent bond`. In a polar covalent bond, electrons spend most of their time closer to the nucleus of the most electronegative atom.


- **Example: the water molecule**. Written as H2O (two hydrogen and one oxygen atom).
- Electrons involved in covalent bonds in water are not shared equally but are held much more tightly by the oxygen nucleus than by the hydrogen nuclei.
- Because electrons are shared unequally in each O-H bond, they spend more time near the oxygen atom, giving it a partial negative charge (recall electrons have a negative charge); they spend less time near the hydrogen atoms, giving them a partial positive charge.
- Lowercase delta is used for this. O has δ- and H has δ+

#### Ionic Bonding & Ions
- `Ionic bonds` are similar to covalent bonds, but electrons in ionic bonds are completely transferred from one atom to another.
    - This electron transfer gives each of the two resulting atoms a full valence shell.
- Atoms or molecules that carry full charges instead of partial charges that come from polar covalent bonds are called `ions`. The sodium ion is written as Na⁺.
    - Positively charged ions are called `cations` (KAT-eye-un).
    - Negatively charged ions are called `anions` (AN-eye-un).
- Examples:
    - E.g. sodium atom (Na) has three electron shells with one lone electron in its valence shell. They can lose that electron to leave them with a second full shell, which is more energetically stable. Because it has one more proton than it has electrons, the atom has a net electric charge of +1.
    - E.g. chlorine atoms (Cl) tend to gain an electron, filling their outermost shell. The resulting ion has a net charge of -1, because it has one more electron than proton.
    - E.g. sodium cations and chloride anions form sodium chloride (NaCL, table salt); held together by strong opposite charges in their ions.
- Covalent bonds share electrons to make both more stable. Ionic bonds are between atoms that have full charges (-1 or +1) and attract strongly.
- **The electron-sharing continuum.** _Equal sharing of electrons to complete transfer of electrons._
    - Nonpolar covalent bonds. _Atoms have no charge, atoms are shared equally._
    - Polar covalent bonds _Atoms have a partial charge because of electronegativity; electrons spend more time around certain atoms in the bond._
    - Ionic bonds. _Atoms have full charges that are directly opposite each other to form strong bonds._
- Note - most compounds present in living organisms are formed with either nonpolar or polar covalent bonds.


#### Simple Molecules formed with C, H, N, O
- `CH4 (Methane)` is formed when four hydrogen atoms are convalently bonded with each of the four unpaired electrons of a carbon atom.
- `NH3 (Ammonia)` is formed when three hydrogen atoms are covalently bonded with three unpaired electrons in nitrogen.
- `H2O (Water)` is formed when two hydrogen atoms bond with two unpaired electrons in oxygen.


- Atoms with more than one unpaired electron in the valence shell can also form double bonds or triple bonds.
- `CO2 (Carbon Dioxide)` is formed when a pair of unmatched electrons in two oxygen atoms are bonded with two pairs of unmatched electrons in a carbon atom.
- `N2 (Molecular Nitrogen)` is formed when the three unmatched electrons in each of two nitrogen atoms bond.


- There are different 3-dimensional geometries to these simple molecules.
    - N2 and CO2 have simple linear structures. There are only two atoms in N2, so the model can only be linear. In CO2, the two C=O bonds repel each other 180 degrees apart.
    - CH4 has a tetrahedral structure, which allows the four C-H bonds to get as far away from each other as possible.
    - Water's bond geometry is bent rather than linear. Has four orbitals in valence shell that repel each other, but two orbitals are filled with unshared electron pairs, which pushes the O-H bonds closer together.


#### Representing Molecules
- Molecular formulas are compact, but don't have much information. Just indicate numbers and types of atoms in molecules. _e.g. CO2, H2O, etc._
- Structural formulas indicate which atoms are bonded together. Single, double, and triple bonds are represented by single, double, and triple dashes. _e.g. O=C=O._
- Ball-and-stick models take up more space than structural formulas both provide information on three-dimensional shapes and indicate sizes of atoms.
- Space-filling models are difficult to read but accurately depict the relative sizes of atoms and their spatial relationships.

### 2.2: Properties of Water and the Early Oceans
- Life is based on water; it arose in an aqueous environment.
    - 75 percent of volume in a typical cell is water.
- Water is an excellent `solvent` - an agent for dissolving, or getting substances into `solution`.
    - e.g. dumping sugar into coffee; the sugar dissappears as the sugar molecules disperse in the aqueous solution. Sugar molecules are separated and interact with water's partial charges.
- Substances are likely to come into contact with one another when they are `solutes` (dissolved into a solvent like water).

#### Properties Correlated with Water's Structure
- Water has small size, highly polar covalent bonds, and a bent shape resulting in unique polarity among molecules.
- ==Water is an efficient solvent.==
- Recall that...
    - ...the covalent O-H bond is polar (difference in electronegativites of hydrogen and oxygen). Oxygen atom has partial negative charge and hydrogen atom has partial positive charge.
    - ...water molecules are bent. This shape makes the partial negative charge on the oxygen atom stick out away from partial positive charges on the hydrogen atoms, gives the water molecule a `polar nature`.
    - When molecules are polar, they carry a partial positive charge on one side and a partial negative charge on the other.
- When two water molecules approach each other, the partial positive charge on hydrogen attracts the partial negative charge on oxygen. This is an example of a `hydrogen bond`.
    - Hydrogen bonds also form between water molecules and polar solutes, like sugar glucose, or between water and ions, like Na⁺ and Cl⁻from table salt.
    - Substances that interact with water this way are `hydrophilic` (water-loving). Almost any ionic compound and polar molecule can dissolve in water.


- Nonpolar molecules do not readily dissolve into aqueous solutions. Substances that do not interact with water are `hydrophobic` (water-fearing).
    - Interactions of hydrophobic molecules with water are minimal or nonexistent; surrounding water molecules form hydrogen bonds *with each other*.
    - These are `hydrophobic interactions`.
- When hydrophobic molecules are close to each other, they are further stabilized by weak electrical attractions, known as `van der Waals interactions`.
- Example: octane (C8H18), a component of gasoline, is a nonpolar molecule; when put in water it is forced to interact with itself, because water is more stable when it interacts with itself rather than with nonpolar molecules.
    - Analogy: Unstable conditions are -1 and 1, stable condition is 0. Combining an unstable -1 with a stable 0 yields -1, still an unstable condition; combining an unstable -1 with an unstable +1 yields a stable 0.
