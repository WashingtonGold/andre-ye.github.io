## Introduction
- Theory of chemical evolution: **life began as a self-replicator**
  - `Self-replicator`: a moelcule that existed by itself in solution *without being enclosed in a membrane.
- To make copies:
  1. Provide a template that could be copied.
  2. Catalyze polymerization reactions that link monomers into a copy of the template.
- **Origin of life researchers propose the first life form was RNA.**
- RNA is a sequence of bases analoous to letters.
  - It can function as an information-containing molecule.
  - Information in RNA can be used to make copies via complementary base pairing.

## The Process of RNA Synthesis/Copying
1. To replicate a single-stranded DNA, create a complementary copy of RNA.
  - The original strand is used as a template.
  - Free ribonucleotides form hydrogen bonds w/ complementary bases on template.
2. The strand is polymerized when 3' hydroxyls and 5' phosphates on adjacent nucleotides link together via condensation reactions.
  - Result: double-stranded RNA molecule.
3. Hydrogen bonds broken by heating or catalyzed reaction.
  - Newly made complementary RNA molecule exists independent of original template.
  
## How Biologists Study the RNA World
- Researchers test RNA world hypothesis by **establishing an environment in the lab that selects ribozymes that catalyze key steps required in RNA world.**
- Two experiments in David Bartel's laboratory:
  - Generate a RNA molecule that could catalyze template polymerization.
    - Mimic process of natural selection, target characteristics of molecules instead of organisms.
    - Isolated a ribozyme that could add 14 nucleotides to an RNA strand.
  - Select a ribozyme that could *make* RNA nucleotides.
    - Began with a large pool of randomly generated RNA sequences.
    - Selected RNAs that could catalyze the addition of a uracil base to ibose sugar.
    - Purified a ribozyme that could perform this task 1 million times more efficiently than uncatalyzed reaction.
      - Molecular evolution occured in reaction tubes.
- Biologists are producing impressive catalytic activites from RNA molecules.

## An RNA World May Have Sparked the Evolution of Life
- Most discovered ribozymes exist in modern cells and play important roles in protein synthesis.
- If ribozymes removed from cells, **proteins would no longer be made.**
  - suggests: **RNA preceded proteins.**
- Evolution of protein enzymes marked the end of the RNA world.
  - It provided the means to catalyze reactions for life to emerge in cellular form.
- Established 3/5 characteristics of life:
  1. **Information.** Proteins and ribozymes process information in nucleic acids to synthesize proteins.
  2. **Replication.** Enzymes (and maybe riboyzmes) replicate nucleic acids that store hereditary information.
  3. **Evolution.** Random changes in nucleic acids can lead to the synthesis of different proteins & ribozyes. This can allow for evolution of new functions.
- If this happened in a hydrothermal vent:
  - Molecular assemblages of nucleic acids & proteins constantly fed thermal & chemical energy.
  - Enzymes moust have evolved to store energy in something more portable.

## Recent Origin-of-Life Experiments
\*Comes from 2.4 of Edition 6 of textbook.
- Production of complex molecules from simple molecules supports claim that the formation of a 'prebiotic soup' was possible.
- Researchers pointed out that early atmosphere had `CO`, `CO2`, and `H2`, not `CH4` and `NH3` (used in Miller's experiment).
- Follow-up experiments occuring under more realistic conditions.

### Synthesis of Precursors Using Light Energy
- Synthesis of formaldehyde from carbon dioxide & hydrogen.
  - `CO2(g) + 2 H2(g) â†’ CH2O(g) + H2O(g)`
