## 2.3: Chemical Reactions, Energy, and Chemical Evolution
- Chemical evolution theory supporters say **simple molecules in the atmosphere and oceans participated in reactions that produced larger and more complex molecules.**

- Two environments.
  - *The atmosphere* in early Earth had many gases (from volcanoes). Water vapor, carbon dioxide, & nitrogen primarily, molecular hydrogen and carbon monoxide in lesser numbers.
  - *Deep-sea hydrothermal vents* were where very hot rocks contacted cracks in the seafloor. Deep-sea vents have lots of gases like carbon dioxide and molecular hydrogen, as well as *reactive metals like nickel & iron*.
- *Very little happens when CO2, N2, H2, CO, and water vapor interact on their own.*
  - How did these molecules evolve to produce large and complex substances in living cells?
  
### How do Chemical Reactions Happen?
- Take, for example, gases that come out of volcanoes to produce carbonic acid:
  - `CO2(*g*) + H2O(*g*) ⇌ CH2O3(*aq*)`
  - The expression is balanced.
    - 1 carbon atom
    - 3 oxygen atoms
    - 2 hydrogen atoms
  
  - `chemical (*state*)` indicates the state of the chemical.
    - `l` for liquid.
    - `g` for gas.
    - `aq` for aqueous.
  
#### Systems & Surroundings, Law of Conservation of Mass 
 - Interacting molecules are *systems*, and everything else is the *surroundings*.
  - Ignore surroundings and focus on the system.
  - `System` as being closed relative to its surroundings.
  - *Mass of reactants always equal to mass of products.*

- `Law of Conservation of Mass`
  - Mass cannot be created or destroyed.
  - It must be rearranged through chemical reactions.

#### Chemical Equilibrium
- Chemical equilibrium (indicated by ⇌).
  - Driving reactions
    - `CO2(*g*) + H2O(*g*) ⇌ CH2O3(*aq*)`
    - Adding more CO2 will drive the reaction to the right, creating more CH2O3.
    - Removing CO2 or adding more CH2O3 will drive the reaction to the left.
  - Temperature
    - `H2O(l) ⇌ H2O(g)` (liquid water and water vapor).
    - Equilibrium cna be altered by changes in temperature.
    - System absorbs thermal energy from surrounding environment; liquid water molecules change from liquid to gas.

#### Endothermic and Exothermic Changes
- When thermal energy is *absorbed* by the system, it is *endothermic* ('within heating').
  - `H2O(l) → H2O(g)` is endothermic. Energy is absorbed to vaporize liquid water.
  
- When thermal energy is *released* to the surroundings, it is *exothermic* ('outside heating').
  - `H2O(g) → H2O(l)` is exothermic. Energy is released when the environment is cooled and vaporized water turns into liquid water

### What is Energy?
- `Energy` - the capacity to do work or supply heat.
  - Capacity: stored potential or active motion.
  
#### Potential Energy & Chemical Energy
- Stored energy is `potential energy`.
- An object gains or loses its ability to store energy b/c of its position.
- Potential energy is related to sharing electrons in covalent bonds.
  - Electrons far from atomic nuclei, bond is long and weak.
    - Greater capacity to be broken apart into new, stronger bonds during reaction.
  - Electrons closer to one or both atoms, bond becomes short and strong.
    - Lesser capacity to be broken apart into new, stronger bonds during reaction.
- Molecule's `chemical energy` is its ability to form stronger bonds is a type of potential energy.

#### Bond Strength
- Electronegativities of atoms affect positionof shared electrons.
- Example:
  - Unequal sharing (polar), low potential energy, short & strong bonds.
    - `O-H`. (All electrons are with O, which has much higher electronegativity).
  - Mostly equal sharing, increasing potential energy, medium-length & power bonds.
    - `N-H`. (Electrons are relatively in the middle, but nitrogen has a slightly larger electronegativity than hydrogen.)
  - Equal electron sharing, high potential energy, long & weak bonds.
    - `C-H`. (Electrons are equally shared b/c both have same weak electronegativities.)

#### Kinetic Energy and Thermal Energy
- Energy of motion is `kinetic energy`.
  - All molecules have at least a little kinetic energy because they are always moving.
  - Kinetic energy in molecular motion is `thermal energy`.
- Thermal energy.
  - `Temperature` of an object measures how much thermal neergy a molecule possesses.
    - Cold object has low temperature. Molecules are moving slower.
    - Hot object has high temperature. Molecules are moving faster.
  - Two objects with diffferent temperatures that come into contact undergo heat transfer.

#### First Law of Thermodynamics
- Energy is conserved.
  - It cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred.
- Energy can only change from one form to another.

#### Heat's Role in Earth's Beginnings
- Energy transformation is at the ❤️️ of chemical evolution.
  - Molecules in early Earth were exposed to lots of energy.
- Kinetic energy (in the form of heat) was present in cooling molten mass that formed the planet.
- Atmosphere and surface of Earth heavily exposed to electricity.
  - Lightning & radiation from the Sun.
- Energy was stored in the chemical bonds of molecules.

### What Makes a Chemical Reaction Spontaneous?
- **Chemical reactions are spontaneous if they can happen on their own.**
  - Do not need any additional influence, like added energy.
  
- Two factors determining if a reaction is spontaneous.
  - *Products have lower potential energy than reactants.*
    - Shared electrons in products are more tightly held than those in reactants.
    - `2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(g)`
      - Electrons in O-H bonds of water are held more tightly than in H-H and O=O bonds.
      - Products have lower potential energy than reactants.
      
  - *Product molecules are less ordered than reactant molecules.
    - Glucose is a single, highly ordered molecule.
    - When glucose burns in air, breaks into gaseous CO2 and H2O(g).
      - Are less ordered than reactant glucose molecules.
  
#### Entropy
- Entropy is the amount of disorder in a system or surrounding environment.
  - Entropy increases when the products of a chemical reaction are less ordered than reactant molecules.
- Spotaneous reactions can occur without *appearing* to increase the entropy.
  - `2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(g)`
    - Potential energy drops.
    - Difference in potential energy released as **heat and light**.
      - Vaporizes the water produced.
- Potential energy & entropy can be used to determine if a reaction is spontaneous or not.
  
#### Second Law of Thermodynamics
- In all spontaneous reactions, entropy *always* increases.
  - Must consider both the system *and* the environment.
- Consider *The Hindenburg*.
  - `2H2(g) + O2(g) → 2H2O(g)`.
    - Molecular hydrogen and diatomic oxygen.
    - Combine to release lots of energy.

  - Today, considered a formal scientific theory.
