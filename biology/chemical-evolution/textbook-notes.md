## 2.3: Chemical Reactions, Energy, and Chemical Evolution
- Chemical evolution theory supporters say **simple molecules in the atmosphere and oceans participated in reactions that produced larger and more complex molecules.**

- Two environments.
  - *The atmosphere* in early Earth had many gases (from volcanoes). Water vapor, carbon dioxide, & nitrogen primarily, molecular hydrogen and carbon monoxide in lesser numbers.
  - *Deep-sea hydrothermal vents* were where very hot rocks contacted cracks in the seafloor. Deep-sea vents have lots of gases like carbon dioxide and molecular hydrogen, as well as *reactive metals like nickel & iron*.
- *Very little happens when CO2, N2, H2, CO, and water vapor interact on their own.*
  - How did these molecules evolve to produce large and complex substances in living cells?
  
### How do Chemical Reactions Happen?
