## Recent Origin-of-Life Experiments
\*Comes from 2.4 of Edition 6 of textbook.
- Production of complex molecules from simple molecules supports claim that the formation of a 'prebiotic soup' was possible.
- Researchers pointed out that early atmosphere had `CO`, `CO2`, and `H2`, not `CH4` and `NH3` (used in Miller's experiment).
- Follow-up experiments occuring under more realistic conditions.

### Synthesis of Precursors Using Light Energy
- Synthesis of formaldehyde from carbon dioxide & hydrogen.
  - `CO2(g) + 2 H2(g) → CH2O(g) + H2O(g)`
  - Researchers show formaldehyde molecules can react with each other to produce large organic compounds, like sugars.
  - Does not occur spontaneously.
- Research group *constructed computer model of Earth's early atmosphere.*
  - Model listed all possible chemical reactions that could occur.
  - Included reactions that occur **when molecules are struck by sunlight.**
    - Light is a source of energy.
  - Computer moldel included reactions that produce highly reactive free radicals.
    - `CO2(g) + 2 H2(g) + sunlight → CH2O(g) + H2O(g)`
    - Balances energy involved.
- **Energy in sunlight could be converted into chemical energy by generating radicals that spontaneously form bonds in formaldehyde.**
- Similar model: researchers show that hydrogen cyanide was an important precursor of molecules required for life.
  - Organic compounds with relatively high potential energy could have accumulated, and groundowrk would have been in place for the prebiotic soup model of chemical revolution.

#### Free Radicals
- Inferred chemical evolution occured when large quantities of high-energy photons bomboarded the planet.
- Atoms in hydrogen moelcules and `CO2` molecules have full valence shells through covalent bonding.
  - Makes molecules unreactive.
- Energy in the form of photons or *intense electrical energy in lightning* (like in Miller's experiment) can break up molecules by knocking apart shared electrons.
  - Fragments that result are **free radicals.**
  - Have unpaired electrons in their outermost shells and are very reactive.

### Concentration and Catalysis in Hydrothermal Vents
- **Stumbling block in prebiotic soup model:** preucrsor molecules would have become diluted when they entered the early oceans.
  - Without concentration, how could formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide meet and form large, complex molecules?
- **Surface metabolism model:** reactants recruited in a defined space.
  - Layer of reactive minerals in walls of deep sea-vent chimneys.
  - Dissolved gases attracted by minerals and concentated on vent-wall surfaces.
- Not only would vent wall minerals bring reactants together, but **be critical to the rate of reactant product formation.**
  - Potential reactions can be spontaneous but would not occur[^1] without a **catalyst.**
  
#### As a Catalyst
- Catalysts provide appropriate chemical environment for reactants to interact with each other.
  - Example: synthesis of acetic acid from carbon dioxide and hydrogen:
    - `2 CO2(aq) + 4 H2(aq) → CH3COOH(aq) + 2 H2O(l)`
    - Spontaneous reaction driven by chemical energy stored in `H2`.
- Importance:
  - Acetic acid can be formed under conditions that simulate a hydrothermal vent environment.
  - Key intermediate in ancient metabolic pathway that produces acetyl CoA, a molecule used by cells throughout tree of life.

#### Evidence of Vent Minerals as Catalysts
- Vent minerals *could* have served as catalysts in synthesis of acetic acid.
- Catalysts perform the same reactions in modern cells contain minerals *similar* to those found in hydrothermalv ents.
  - Preliminary results: a variety of carbon-based molecules are formed under early Earth conditions.
  - Precursors of synthesis of nucleotides.


### The Two Theories

| Theory | Process |
| --- | ------------------ |
| Prebiotic Soup Model | Simple molecules like `N2`, `NH3`, and `CO` were present in the atmosphere of ancient earth. Energy in sunlight drove reactions among simple molecules to produce molecules like `formaldehyde` and `hydrogen cyanide`. Stimulated by heat, the products formed more complex molecules like `ribose`, `glycine`, and `acetaldehyde`. |
| Surface Metabolism Model | Simple molecules like `N2`, `NH3`, and `CO` were present in early oceans and hydrothermal events. Vent minerals catalyzed spontaneous reactions among high-energy molecules to produce, for instance, `acetic acid`. Concentration and heat formed more complex molecules like ribose.
