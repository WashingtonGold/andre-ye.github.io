## The Mysterious Origins of Life on Earth
- [Source](https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-mysterious-origins-of-life-on-earth-luka-seamus-wright)
- Billions of years ago, simple organic compounds assmebled into complex reproducible compouds.
  - Gave rise to every one of billions of species in our planet since.
- Earth was almost entirely devoid of a suitable environment for living things in its early days.
  - Widespread volcanic activity
  - Atmosphere with hostile conditions.
- Elements and compounds for life: hydrogen, nitrogen, methane, carbon dioxide, phosphate, ammonia.
  - How to co-mingle and react?
  - Need a solvent: water.
- All life needs a source of energy.
- Life forms:
  - Autotrophs. Plants, generate their onw energy.
  - Heterotrophs. Animals, consume other organisms for their energy.
  - First organism: autotrophy.
- Locations that meet criteria.
  - Places on land or close to surface of ocean have access to sunlight.
  - UV radiation on Earth's surface was too harsh for life to survive.
  - Hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor are covered in seawater.
- **Hydrothermal vent**
  - Fissure in Earth's crust.
  - Seawater seeps into the magma chambers and is ejected back out at high temperatures with rich minerals and simple compounds.
  - Energy is concentrated in chemical gradients of thermal vents.
- **Last Universal Common Ancestor** (LUCA)
  - What does LUCA look like?
  - Scientists identify genes across three domains of life.
    - Archaea, bacteria, eukarya
  - Must have been inherited in a common ancestor.
  - LUCA lived in a hot, oxygen-free place and harvested energy from a chemical gradient.
- Two tkinds of hydrothermal vent
  - Black smoker. Release acidic, carbon dioxide rich water, heated to 100s of degrees Clesius. Packed with metals essential to life. **Too hot for LUCA.**
  - White smoker. Probably it.
- Lost City favored for the cradle of life.

## Life's Rocky Start | Deep Sea Vents
- Dark ocean floor - more than a mile below the surface - explorers found mineral-rich hydrothermal vents.
  - Like underwater volcanoes.
- Reached almost 600 degrees; yet life *thrived.**
