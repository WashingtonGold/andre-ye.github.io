## The Mysterious Origins of Life on Earth
- [Source](https://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-mysterious-origins-of-life-on-earth-luka-seamus-wright)
- Billions of years ago, simple organic compounds assmebled into complex reproducible compouds.
  - Gave rise to every one of billions of species in our planet since.
- Earth was almost entirely devoid of a suitable environment for living things in its early days.
  - Widespread volcanic activity
  - Atmosphere with hostile conditions.
- Elements and compounds for life: hydrogen, nitrogen, methane, carbon dioxide, phosphate, ammonia.
  - How to co-mingle and react?
  - Need a solvent: water.
- All life needs a source of energy.
- Life forms:
  - Autotrophs. Plants, generate their onw energy.
  - Heterotrophs. Animals, consume other organisms for their energy.
  - First organism: autotrophy.
- Locations that meet criteria.
  - Places on land or close to surface of ocean have access to sunlight.
  - UV radiation on Earth's surface was too harsh for life to survive.
  - Hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor are covered in seawater.
- **Hydrothermal vent**
  - Fissure in Earth's crust.
  - Seawater seeps into the magma chambers and is ejected back out at high temperatures with rich minerals and simple compounds.
  - Energy is concentrated in chemical gradients of thermal vents.
- **Last Universal Common Ancestor** (LUCA)
  - What does LUCA look like?
  - Scientists identify genes across three domains of life.
    - Archaea, bacteria, eukarya
  - Must have been inherited in a common ancestor.
  - LUCA lived in a hot, oxygen-free place and harvested energy from a chemical gradient.
- Two tkinds of hydrothermal vent
  - Black smoker. Release acidic, carbon dioxide rich water, heated to 100s of degrees Clesius. Packed with metals essential to life. **Too hot for LUCA.**
  - White smoker. Probably it.
- Lost City favored for the cradle of life.

## Life's Rocky Start | Deep Sea Vents
- [Source](https://kcts9.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/buac16-912-sci-ess-nvlrsvents/wgbh-nova-lifes-rocky-start-deep-sea-vents/)
- Dark ocean floor - more than a mile below the surface - explorers found mineral-rich hydrothermal vents.
  - Like underwater volcanoes.
- Reached almost 600 degrees; yet life *thrived.**
- **Not off the sun's energy, but chemical energy.**
  - life can thrive without sunlight.
  - Extreme temperature and pressure; yet extreme to us is **not extreme to microbes.**
  - Could this dark and unlikely environment be where life began?
- Life's building blocks in the conditions of a deep sea vnet.
  - Miller-Urey experiment in high pressure.
  - Pressure bombs - things can explode.
  - Model the environment of the deep sea vents in a small gold tube.
    - *nothing happened.*
  - Basic gasses (nitrogen, `CO2`), etc. 
    - Hold in a gold tube, but nothing happens.
  - Squeezing and heating had no effect.
- The spark kickstarts the chemistry.
  - It's missing the spark.
- Try putting rocks and minerals in.
  - Put in "early earth cocktail"
  - Run the experiment again.
  - Atoms reform into new organic molecules: **amino acids**.
- When powdered rocks and minerals are put in the capsules, organic molecules form.

## What is the Metabolism-First Hypothesis for the Origiin of Life?
- Mystery of the origin of life has not been solved.
  - Macromolecules: genes and proteins.
- **Cellular metabolism** - a sum total of all controlled chemical reactions that occur inside a cell.
  - Eat and digest an apple - bits are given to the bloodstream.
  - Cells' metabolism transforms food into new parts of the cell.
- Biological evolution (Darwinian evolution) can create highly complex structures and systems.
- **How can something make copies of itself and mutate?**
- Macromolecule-first Models: metabolism generated automatically.
  - Comes with formation of amino acids, chains, etc.
- First, needed to generate **building blocks**.
  - Produce junk along with amino acids.
    - Tar paradox
    - Looking at wrong conditions?
- Some aspect of modern metabolism must have existed *before* the macromolecules could have come.
  - If an ancient environment existed that was producing macromolecules, natural selection would favor any macromolecule that could enhance the environmental chemical reactions that produced its building blocks.
  - Widely shared traits are probably the oldest.
- Reverse Citric Acid Cycle
  - Found in microbes
  - Feeds on things like `CO2  and `H2`.
  - Very common in the early Earth.
  - Bind to produce larger pathways to build sugars, fats, and amino acids.
  - Avoiding tar paradox.
- Find a system that generates macromoelcuels from simple elements.
- **metabolism-first hypothesis**: some aspect of modern metabolism existed naturally in the environment before genes and proteins.

## What is the RNA World Hypothesis?
- Did chains of RNA exist first and kickstart life?
- Chains of RNA are found abundantly in all living cells.
  - Chemical cousin to DNA.
- RNA chains can replicate & evolve with their environments.
- RNA World Hypothesis: **Earth's chemistry was producing random chains of RNA. These began competing with each other for survival. Eventually formed living cells. Survival machines for RNA to live inside.
- Researchers find that base pairing lets RNA evolve.
- Template for its own replication.
  - Complementary strand is born with exact inverse sequence.
  - Water is heated; both chains are broken and act as templates.
  - Sometimes, mutations slip in; chains that compete for survival.
  - **True evolution can operate on chains of RNA.**
  - Base pairing gives RNA a special ability:
    - Water cool enough for base pairing but no enough nucleotides for pairing;
    - Chains will fold up and base pair with themselves sometimes.
    - Certain sticky bases point out can cause unique chemical reactions.
    - Many different shapes of RNA are **ribozymes**.
      - Some can join molecules together or split them apart.
      - Shape determined by sequence, shape determines function.
- How difficult would it be to develop survival functions?
  - Build nucleotides out of chemicals it ifnds in its environment?
  - Some randomly generated chains could randomly generate nucleotides.
  - PCR to generate random mutations.
  - Highly efficient ribozymes actively participate in their own survival.
  - Blur the line between living things and simple chemistry.
- **Unsolved question:** how did the backbone get put together?
  - Other molecules: self-assembling proto-RNA

## The RNA Origin of Life
- Map out evolution to single-celled life.
- DNA is a good way to store information but doesn't do much else.
- Cells rely on other molecules to survive.
- Proteins are good molecular machines, but cannot store information (need DNA).
- DNA needs protein to function, proteins need DNA to function.
- Answer: **RNA**.
  - RNA came first.
  - RNA can store information, or perform various functions.
- RNA World Hypothesis.
  - Billions of years ago, self-replicating RNA formed.
  - Self-replicating RNAs formed and developed.
- Competed - survival of the fittest.
- RNAs developed the ability to develop proteins.
- Critical RNAs mutated into DNA. Stable archive of genetic information.
- Life becam emore complex with good accidents and several tiny steps.
- Slice, dice, transform, encode molecules.
