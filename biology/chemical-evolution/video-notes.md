## Figure Walthrough: Potential Energy Change During Chemical Reactions
- What makes a chemical reaction spontaneous?
  - Large drop in potential energy as reactants converted to products.
- What causes the change in energy?
- Reactants: `2 H2` + `O2`.
  - Covalent bonds. Electrons are shared equally
  - Form nonpolar covalent bonds.
  - Same electronegativities.
  - Are held 'losely'.
- Product: `2 H2O`.
  - Two water molecules.
  - Bonds are polar covalent; oxygen atom has higher electronegativity than hydrogen.
  - Shared electrons are held 'tightly'.
  - Polar bonds have lower potential energy.
- High potential energy to low potential energy.
  - Difference in potential energy means there is a drop in energy; what happened to the rest of the energy?
  - Changed to kinetic energy and released in heat and light.
  - Many reactions form a very powerful energy outburst.

## What Was the Miller-Urey Experiment?
- Once believed that leaving food out to rot would cause animals to suddenly appear.
  - Spontaneous generation.
- "Omne vivum ex vivo", life only comes from life.
  - Rats, maggots, microbes are too complex to simply 'poof' into existent.
- Drawin: theory of evolution.
  - Under the right situations, simple creatures turn into more complex ones.
- Is it possible that simple life cells could come from nonliving matter?
  - Alexander Oparin published "The Origin of Life'
    - Thoughts on the progression of life:
      1. Simple molecules
      2. Molecules of life (biomonomers)
      3. Macromolecules
      4. Polymer Complexes
      5. Metabolic Networks
      6. Living Cells
    - Early ocean as a soup of complex molecules produced by natural reactions.

<br>

- How to test or observe?
- Stanley Miller came up with an idea: simulate early Earth conditions in a lab.
- Simulated early water conditions.
  - Added hydrogen, ammonia, and methane.
  - Added a condensor to cool the atmosphere, allowing water molecules to fall into ocean like rain.
  - Added sparks in the atmosphere to simulate lightning.
- Not to create life, but test simple molecules to biomonomers.

<br>

- Oceans had amino acids and other complex molecules.
- Gave rise to a field of reearch: prebiotic chemistry.
- Scientist's don't know if gases used by Miller were the most accurate.
  - Experiments show many different sources of environments work.
- Molecules of life formed everywhere.
- Significant:
  - Not perfect simulation, but demonstrated that biomolecules can form from simple molecules.
  - Transformed speculation into science.

## Steven Hawking Asks What Are the Building Blocks of Life and How Did They Come to Be
- How did biological machinery come about?
- Amino acids
  - Early building blocks of life.
  - How did they first form?
- 4 billion years back in time
  - Where do basic building blocks come from?
    - Randomly appear?
  - Stanley Miller & Harold Urey
- Magnets as atoms.
- When energy is applied, interesting things happen.
  - Amino acids and molecules can form by themselves.
  - Just need the right energy and the right surroundings.
- Proteins from amino acids.
  - Miller produced 5 amino acids.
