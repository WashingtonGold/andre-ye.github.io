## Introduction
- DNA has been called the blueprint of life, but how is it brought to life?
- **Molecular biology** begins with the discovery that DNA is the hereditary material.
- How does information in DNA translate to action?
  - How does **gene expression** occur?
  - *Process of converting information in DNA to molecules that do things.*

## 16.1: What Do Genese Do?
- George Beadle and Edward Tatum published a series of important experiments.
  - Idea: knock out a gene by damaging it and then infer what the gene does by observing the phenotype of the mutant individual.
- Alleles that do not function are *null alleles*.
- This strategy is one of the most effective research strategies.

### The One-Gene, One-Enzyme Hypothesis
- Beadle & Tatum used the bread mold *Neurospora crassa.*
- Exposed *N. crassa* to radiation, which can damage DNA.
  - Inability to produce pyridoxine (vitamin B6) was due to a defect in one gene.
  - Failure to synthesize other genes were due to defects in those genes.
- **One-gene, one-enzyme hypothesis:** mutants could not make a compound because it lacked an enzyme to synthesize it.
  - Proposed that the lack of enzyme was due to genetic defect.
  - Proposed that each gene contains information needed to make an enzyme.
  
### An Experimental Test of the Hypothesis
- Adrian Srb and Normal Horowitz published a test of the one-gene, one-enzyme hypothesis.
- Biologists focused on the ability of *N. crassa* to synthesize amino acid arginine.
  - Normal cells grow well on a medium without arginine.
  - Wild-type cells produce their own arginine.
- Arginine is synthesized in a **metabolic pathway**.
  - Ornithine and citrulline are intermediate products on the metabolic pathway leading to arginine.
- Srb & Horowitz hypothesized that particular *N. crassa* genes are responsible for producing the three enzymes in the metabolic pathway.
- Srb & Horowitz used radiation to create mutant cells.
- **Genetic screen** - a technique for picking out specific types of mutants.

#### Tabular Form

| Aspect | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Question | What do genes do? |
| Hypothesis | Each gene contains information needed to make one enzyme. |
| Null Hypothesis | Genes do not have a one-to-one correspondence with enzymes. |
| Experimental Strategy | Produce mutants unable to synthesize arginine, then test different steps in the mtabolic pathway for synthesizing arginine. |
| Experimental Setup | Isolate *Neurospora crassa* that cannot synthesize arginine in four environments: no supplement, supplemented with only ornithine, supplemented only with citrulline, supplemented only with arginine |
| Prediction of Hypothesis | There will be 3 distinct types of mutants corresponding to defects in enzyme 1, 2, and 3 in the pathway for synthesizing arginine. Each mutant will be able to grow  on different combinations. |
| Prediction of Null Hypothesis | There will not be a simple correspondence between a particular mutation and a particular enzyme. |
| Results | Three types of mutants *arg1*, *arg2*, *arg3*. They are able to grow in the metabolic pathway *from* orthinine, citrulline, and arginine, respectively. *arg1* cells lack enzyme 1 from precursor to orthinine, *arg2* cells lack enzyme 2 from orthinine to citrulline, etc. |
| Conclusion | The one-gene, one-enzyme hypothesis is supported. |

## 16.2: The Central Dogma of Molecular Biology
- How does DNA code the production of enzymes?
- Part of the answer: structure of DNA.
- Watson and Crick's model offered little hope that DNA could directly catalyze reactions.
  - DNA does not allow it to bind to many substrates needed for protein synthesis.

### The Genetic Code Hypothesis
- Francis Crick proposed that the sequence of bases in DNA acted like a code.
  - DNA was only for information storage.
  - It would need to be read and used to produce proteins.
- Different combinations of bases could specify the 20 amino acids (like different dots and ashes in Morse code specify the 26 letters of the alphabet).
- Stretch of DNa can contain information needed to build an amino acid.

### RNAas the Intermediary between Genes and Proteins
- DNA must go through an intermediary structure to produce proteins.
  - Understood from cell structure: DNA is enclosed in the nucleus, but ribosomes (where protein synthesis happens) lies outside of the nucleus.
- Francois Jacob and Jacques Monod suggested RNA molecules linked genes to the protein-manufacturing centers in the cytoplasm.
- Single-stranded RNA (messenger RNA or mRNA) carry information out of the nucleus from DNA to protein synthesis sites in the cytoplasm. 
  - **RNA polymerase can synthesize this complementary RNA molecule.**
  - Does not need a primer to begin connecting ribonucleotides together.

### Dissecting the Central Dogma
- Central dogma: DNA (information storage) to RNA (information carrier) to Proteins (cell machinery)
  - The flow of information between molecules (not conversion of one molecule into another).

#### The Roles of Transcription and Translation
- **Transcription** is using a DNA template to make an RNA molecule. Transcribed with RNA polymerase.
- **Translation** is the process of using information in the base sequence of mRNA to synthesize porteins. Information in mRNA is translated into proteins by ribosomes.

#### Linking Genotypes to Phenotypes
- An organism's genotype is determined by the sequence of bases in its DNA.
- Its phenotype is the product of the proteins it produces.
- Extension of Crick's idea: DNA (genotype) to mRNA to proteins to phenotype.
- Each DNA sequence contributes to an **allele** (form) of the gene.
  - The result of these two different DNA sequences is the production of proteins that differ in amino acid sequence.

#### Modifications of the Central Dogma
- Highlights of new discoveries:
  - Many genes code for RNA molecules that do not function as mRNAs (transcribed from DNA but never translated into proteins), but can control many important phenotypes.
  - Information sometimes flows from RNA to DNA.
- Discovery of 'reverse' information: group of viruses whose genes consisted of RNA.
  - Reverse transcriptase synthesizes a DNA version of the genes.
- Central dogma is important, but life is not always as clean.

## 16.3: The Genetic Code
- Once biologists understood the pattern of information flow, they asked: how can the base sequence of mRNA code become amino acids?
- Genetic code: the relationship between a sequence of nucleotides in DNA or RNA and the seuqence of amino acids in a protein.

### How Long is a Word in the Genetic Code?
- Genetic language, words specify amino acids. How long is the message that designates one amino acid?
- George Gamow: each genetic word contains 3 bases.
  - There are only 4 different bases (A, U, G, C). A one-base code can specify only 4 different amino acids.
  - A two-base code can represent 16 different amino acids.
  - A three-base code can represent 64 different amino acids.
- Three-base code (**triplet code**) is shortest genetic code for at least 20 amino acids.
  - The genetic code may be redundant (amino acid can be specified by more than one triplet of bases).
- **Codon** - group of three bases that specifies an amino acid.
  - Different codons might mean the same amino acid (e.g. AAA and AAG).

#### Francis Crick and Sydney Brenner Experiment
- Developed an experiment to see if codons were actually 3 bases long.
- Used chemicals that caused an occasional addition or deletion of a base pair.
- This led to the loss of function in the gene being studied.
- A single addition or deletion throws the sequence of codons (**reading frame**) out of register.
- Functional proteins were produced when sequences were eliminated when three base pairs were eliminated altogether.

### How Did Researchers Crack the Code?
- Marshall Nirenberg and Heinrich Matthaei developed a method of synthesizing RNAs composed of single-type of ribonucleotide.
  - RNA triplet UUU codes for phenylalanine.
  - RNA triplet AAA codes for lysine.
  - RNA triplet CCC codes for proline.
- Extended this work to create RNAs from different mixtures of different nucleotides.
  - Researchers could predict how often a paticular triplet woul occur on average in RNA molecules.
  - Ribosome-binding experiments enabled Nirenberg & Leder to fill in the meanings of all remaining unknown codons.
- **Some codons do not specify amino acids.**
  - Instead, they signal an end fo the reading frame.
- **Start codons**. AUG start codon signals protein synthesis should began at that point.
- **Three stop codons** (termination codons) with sequences UAA, UAG, and UGA. Stop codons signal for the end fo a reading frame (end of a polypeptide).
