## 17.1: An Overview of Transcription
- The first step in using genetic information is transcription.
  - This is the synthesis of an RNA version of the instructions in archive.
- Enzymes called **RNA polymerases** are important in transcription.
  - RNA polymerases use monomers called ribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) used for DNA synthesis.
- These are like dNTPs used for DNA synthesis but have a hydroxyl group at the 2' carbon.
- Once an NTP is in place, the RNA polymerase catalyzes a reaction that cleaves off the two phosphates and forms a phosphodiester linkage.
  - Forms between the 3' end of the growing mRNA chain and the new ribonucleoside monophosphate.
- RNA that is complementary to one of the DNA strands is synthesized in 5' to 3' direction.
- Terminology:
  - The strand read by RNA polymerase is the **template strand.**
  - The other strand is the **coding strand.**
    - The RNA sequence matches it, because it is synthesized in the same direction.
- RNA polymerase does not require a primer to begin transcription.
- Bacteria have a single RNA polymerase; eukaryotes have at least three distinct types.

### Initiation: How Does Transcription Begin in Bacteria?
- One way of thinking about a gene: a stretch of DNA that is transcribed to produce a functional product for a cell.
  - How does RNA polymerase find genes?
- **Initiation** is key to control.
- **Core enzyme**, which transcribes the genes, needs **sigma** protein to bind to the core enzyme to recognize sites where transcription should begin.
  - Sites are called **promoters**.
- Bacterial RNA polymerase core enzyme and sigma form a **holoenzyme** ('whole enzyme').

#### Bacterial Promoters
- David Pribnow: offered an initial answer in the mid-1970s.
- Pribnow found that promoters were 40-50 base pairs long and had a series of bases identical or similar to TATAAT.
  - Known as the -10 box, because it is centered about 10 bases from the point where transcriptionb egins.
- RNA polymerase moves *downstream* from a point of reference, DNA is said to be *upstream* from the point of reference.
- The sequence TTGACA is 35 bases upstream of the +1 site called the -35 box.
