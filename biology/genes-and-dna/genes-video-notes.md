## DNA Replication and RNA Transcription and Translation
*By Khan Academy. Access [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/in-in-class-12-biology-india/xc09ed98f7a9e671b:in-in-the-molecular-basis-of-inheritance/xc09ed98f7a9e671b:in-in-transcription-and-rna-processing/v/rna-transcription-and-translation){:target="_blank"}.*
- DNA's structure makes it suitable for being the molecular basis of heredity.
- Needs to be *replicable*.
  - As a cell divides, the two daughter cells should have the same information.
- Replication: construct another side of DNA based on a given side.
- Expression
  - DNA - talking about a molecule with the double helix structure.
  - A DNA molecule with other proteins to give it a larger structure is a chromosome.
  - A gene is a part of DNA used to code for a certain type of protein.
- RNA is used to convert DNA's information (genotype) into proteins.
- RNA is a messenger between a section of DNA and what goes on outside of the nucleus.
- DNA to mRNA is **transcription.**
  - Adenine pairs with uracil instead of thymine.
- mRNA to proteins is **translation.**
  - Every three bases codes for a specific amino acid.
  - Represents a *codon*.

## Transcription and mRNA Processing
*By Khan Academy. Access [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/in-in-class-12-biology-india/xc09ed98f7a9e671b:in-in-the-molecular-basis-of-inheritance/xc09ed98f7a9e671b:in-in-transcription-and-rna-processing/v/transcription-and-mrna-processing){:target="_blank"}.*
- Transcription: going from DNA to mRNA.
- Focusing on genes (genotypes).
- In eukaryotic cells, transcription happens inside the nucleus.
  - DNA to pre-mRNA, processed into mRNA, which leaves the nucleus to be translated.

### RNA Polymerase and Building RNA
- Protein coding gene: primary actor is RNA polymerase.
- RNA polymerase needs to know where to start. Attaches to a **promoter** sequence of DNA. Indicates where to start.
- Once it attaches, it separates the strands, then is able to code for RNA.
- Only encodes one side (5' to 3').
- This side that it is being interacted with is the *template strand.*
- Will contain the same information as the *coding strand* (opposite the template strand).
- Stops until it reaches a *terminator.*
  - Multiple ways to signal: creates something structurally that forces it to let go.
  - mRNA can form a hairpin (needs the right base pairs), which makes it impair the polymerase and lets go.
  - Might be sequences that part of the polymerase complex recognizes.
- Prokaryote: done. Messenger RNA is ready to go.

### Eukaryotic Processing
- Things are added: 5' cap (modified guanine) on the 5' end that helps the process.
- Poly-A tail is several adenines on the 3' end.
  - Helps make sure the information is more robust.
  - Makes it less likely the mRNA will be processed.
- In the mRNA sequence, will have *nonsense* sequences, introns.
  - Not coding for a protein.
  - These are processed out (spliced out).
- Leaves behind the *exons* (parts that code for genes).
- Results a *mature* mRNA that codes for the proteins.

## Translation and Protein Synthesis
*By Khan Academy. Access [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/in-in-class-12-biology-india/xc09ed98f7a9e671b:in-in-the-molecular-basis-of-inheritance/xc09ed98f7a9e671b:in-in-translation/v/translation-mrna-to-protein){:target="_blank"}.*
- On the strand of DNA, there are sequences called genes.
  - Each code for specific polypeptides or a protein.
- How do you go from information (gene) to a protein?
- Translation: mRNA to proteins. 

<br>

- The ribosome is made up of proteins and ribosomal RNA.
  - mRNA does not need to only code information, it can also provide a functional structural role.
- 'top bun' and 'bottom' end, reads it and turns it into a sequence of amino acids.
- Every 3 nucleotides is a codon.
- Information is encoded in the nitrogenous bases.
- AUG: start codon, this is where the protein begins being built by the ribosome.
- Three stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA).

<br>

- tRNA is transfer RNA. Many different tRNAs that combine to each of the amino acids.
- On parts of the tRNA, have *anti-codons* that combine with the actual codons.
  - e.g. AUG and UAC (bound to methionine amino acid).
- Anti-codon matches up with the actual codon on the mRNA.
- The other end of the molecule is where the maino acid is actually bound.

<br>

- A-site
  - A-site is where appropriate tRNA initially bounds to the amino acid.
  - Another t-RNA will bond at the A-site, bringing the appropriate amino acid. (A stands for aminoacyl).
  - A peptide bond can form and the ribosome moves.
- P-site
  - The original A-site becomes the P-site.
  - Polypeptide bonds are stored in this area.
- E-site
  - The original P-site becomes the E-site.
  - The tRNA exit at the E-site (disassociate from the amino acids).
- Antibiotics hurt the function of ribosomes of bacterium but not eukaryotes.
