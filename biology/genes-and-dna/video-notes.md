## Khan Academy: Central Dogma
[Access here.](#https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/mcat/biomolecules/amino-acids-and-proteins1/v/central-dogma-of-molecular-biology-2)
- Explains how we take information and generate a human.
- Credited with discovering this dogma; residue-by-residue transfer of information.

### DNA Makes RNA Makes Protein
- DNA copies itself through replication.
- DNA can be copied into RNA through transcription.
- RNA can be used to synthesize proteins through translation.

- Each monomer is connected to, at most, one other monomer.
- Specific sequence of each monomer encodes information, and the transfer of information is preserved from DNA to RNA to protein.
- Each polymer is used for the synthesis of the next polymer.
- One could take DNA and see what the RNA would look like, which could be used to determine what the Protein is.

### Memorizing Terms
- Replication: DNA making copies of itself.
- Transcription: script. Think of it as going from one written form to another form. Both DNA to RNA use nucleotides. Just using one type of alphabet to another.
- Translation: going across languages. Going from nucleotide 'language' to amino acid 'language'.

## Pearson Media: The Hershey-Chase Experiment
- In 1953, Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase confirmed DNA's role in genetics.
- T2 Phage consists of head, sheath, tail, and base plate. DNA is packaged in the head of the virus.
- The Phage attaches to *E. coli* by its tail and injects genetical material. This directs viral enzymes to produce viral offspring.
- The bacterium breaks open and the phages are released.
- T2 consists of protein and DNA. One must contain the genetic material.
- Phages had radioactive DNA or radioactive proteins. 
  - Medium containing radioactive isotope 32P for radioactive DNA.
  - Medium containing radioactive isotope 35S for radioactive proteins.
- Infected *E. coli* with the two types of the phage. Separated phages from rest of the cell. Labelled DNA appeared in host cell but not 'ghosts'. Labelled proteins appeared in 'ghosts' but not host cell.
- Offspring of T2 with labelled DNA were radioactive. Offspring of T2 with labelled protein were not radioactive.
- Convinced the scientific community that DNA was the hereditary material.

## Khan Academy: Semiconservative Replication
[Access here.](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/in-in-class-12-biology-india/xc09ed98f7a9e671b:in-in-the-molecular-basis-of-inheritance/xc09ed98f7a9e671b:in-in-dna-replication/v/semi-conservative-replication)
- Take a piece of DNA and unwind it into its two strands.
- If we were to replicate DNA, what would the end result look like?
- Three choices:
  - Conservative replication. Synthesize a completely new pair.
  - Dispersive replication. End up with 2 pairs of DNA; each pair have some old DNA and new DNA dispersed within the DNA.
  - Semiconservative replication. Each pair has one old strand and one new strand.

### Meselsohn-Stahl Experiment
- Proved that DNA replication was semi-conservative.

## Bozeman Science: The Meselson-Stahl Experiment
[Access here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcUQ_TZCG0w)
- Idea: semi-conservative, conservative, and dispersal models.
- Grew *E. coli*, a bacteria, in *heavy nitrogen* (`15N`). Has an extra neutron.
  - When spun in centrifuge, DNA that contains it will be moved to the bottom. Density of DNA can be used to figure out what is being added.
- Switched heavy nitrogen to normal nitrogen and observed what happened in each generation.
- `14N` (normal nitrogen) and `15N` (heavy nitrogen)
- To make a copy, DNA splits itself in the middle.

## Pearson Media: DNA Replication
- Every cell in you rbody is produced with cell division.
- DNA replication comes from studies of *E. coli*; found in the large intestine.

### The Replication Fork
- At the origin of replication, two strands of DNA separate to serve as templates.
- Forms a replication bubble. Grows in two directions.
- Forms two replication forks.
- Many proteins work together at the replication fork.
- DNA is unzipped; DNA polymerase builds new strands of DNA.
- Strands in a DNA helix must be made in different ways.

### Synthesis of the Leading Strand
- Build continuously in the direction of the unzip.
- DNA polymerase builds a new strand of DNA by adding DNA nucleotides one at a time.
- Each nucleotide must pair with its complementary nucleotide.
- Works the same on both leading and lagging strands.

### Lagging Strand
- Built in pieces.
- Each piece of the lagging strand begins with a short segment of RNA.
- A clamp surrounds the RNA and attaches to DNA polymerase; builds the rest of the piece as DNA.
- When piece is finished, it is released from DNA polymerase.
- A different DNA polymerase removes RNA and replaces it with DNA.
- Cannot finish connecting the pieces. DNA ligase joins the pieces together.

### Finishing Replication
- Growth of leading and lagging strands grows on both sides until there are two identical DNA molecules.
- Process of replication in bacterial is similar to what happens in our own cells. 

## Pearson Media: Figure Walkthrough, Leading and Lagging Strand Synthesis
- DNA strand synthesis is simple in theory but complex in practice.
- DNA replication requires leading and lagging strands.
- Each strand of DNA is polar. Right or left ends; 5' end and 3' ends (phosphate and hydroxyl groups).
- During DNA synthesis, new building blocks can only be added to the 3' end of the chain.
- In double-stranded DNA, the two must be antiparalel.
- For leading strand, synthesized from 5' to 3' in opposite direction of the template strand.
  - Same direction as the DNA is unwinding.
- Lagging strand is synthesized in 5' to 3' opposite to that of the template; moves in the oppoiste direction of moving replication fork.
- When a lagging strand becomes sufficiently long, it will be used as a template for newly synthesized DNA.
