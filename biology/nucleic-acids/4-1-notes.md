# Textbook Notes - Nucleic Acids and an RNA World - 4.1: What is a Nucleic Acid?
Andre Ye, 10/22/2020

## Introduction
- Life began when chemicals evolved to the point where **molecules could promote their own replication**.
- `Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA)` stores genetic information and is replicated using proteins.
- `RNA world hypothesis` says that there was a stage in life's evolution where `ribonucleic acid (RNA)` stored genetic information *and* catalyzed its own replication.
  - Did life on Earth begin with DNA first?
  - Did it do some replicating, evolving into a molecule just before RNA?
  - Did RNA precede DNA and proteins?

## Nucleic Acids
- Nucleic acids are `polymers`, like proteins.
- **Instead of being assembled from amino acids, nucleic acids are made up of `nucleotides`**.
- There are three components of a nucleotide.
  - A phosphate group.
  - A five-carbon sugar.
  - A nitrogenous (contains nitrogen) base.
- Phosphate group bonds to a sugar molecule, which bonds to the base.
