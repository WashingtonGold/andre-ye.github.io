# Textbook Notes - Nucleic Acids and an RNA World - 4.1: What is a Nucleic Acid?
Andre Ye, 10/22/2020

## Introduction
- Life began when chemicals evolved to the point where **molecules could promote their own replication**.
- `Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA)` stores genetic information and is replicated using proteins.
- `RNA world hypothesis` says that there was a stage in life's evolution where `ribonucleic acid (RNA)` stored genetic information *and* catalyzed its own replication.
  - Did life on Earth begin with DNA first?
  - Did it do some replicating, evolving into a molecule just before RNA?
  - Did RNA precede DNA and proteins?

## Nucleic Acids
- Nucleic acids are `polymers`, like proteins.
- **Instead of being assembled from amino acids, nucleic acids are made up of `nucleotides`**.
- There are three components of a nucleotide.
  - A phosphate group.
  - A five-carbon sugar.
    - A central component in the nucleotide.
    - Five carbons in the sugar are usually labelled with numbers and prime (`'`) symbols. For example, base is attached to 1' carbon and phosphate group attached to 5' carbon.
  - A nitrogenous (contains nitrogen) base.
- Phosphate group bonds to a sugar molecule, which bonds to the base.

ribonucleotides
: monomers of RNA (ribonucleic acid). sugar is ribose.
deoxyribonucleotides
: monomers of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). sugar is deoxyribus.
*deoxy*-
: prefix for 'lacking oxygen'.

## Nitrogenous Bases
- `purines` - consist of double rings formed from nine atoms.
  - adenine (A) (note - has 'nine' in name)
  - guanine (G) (note - has 'nine' in name)
- `pyrimidines` - consist of single rings formed from six atoms.
  - cytosine (C)
  - uracil (U) (used by ribonucleotides)
  - thymine (T) (used by deoxyribonucleotides)

## Drawing Nucleotides
phosphate
: usually represented as a circle.
sugar
: usually represented as a pentagon with an upright tail.
nitrogenous base
: usually represented as a hexagon.
covalent bond
: usually represented with a line.
  
## Chemical Evolution in the Production of Nucleotides
- If nucleic acids played a role in chemical evolution of life, then there **must have been at least some nucleotides present in prebiotic oceans**.
- Most biologists _accept the idea that `amino acids` could have been synthesized early in Earth's history_.
  - Nitrogenous bases and types of sugars[^1] can be synthesized under conditions like those in early Earth oceans, particularly deep-sea hydrothermal vent systems.
    - Reactive minerals on the surface of walls in deep-sea vents **bind to ribose, effectively enriching and concentrating ribose[^2] from a pool of diverse sugars.**

## How do Nucleotides Polymerize to Form Nucleic Acids?
- **Once nucleotides formed, how would they polymerize to form nucleic acids?
- To be continued.




[^1]: like ribose
[^2]: a sugar in RNA
