# 4.1: What is a Nucleic Acid?

## Introduction
- Life began when chemicals evolved to the point where **molecules could promote their own replication**.
- `Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA)` stores genetic information and is replicated using proteins.
- `RNA world hypothesis` says that there was a stage in life's evolution where `ribonucleic acid (RNA)` stored genetic information *and* catalyzed its own replication.
  - Did life on Earth begin with DNA first?
  - Did it do some replicating, evolving into a molecule just before RNA?
  - Did RNA precede DNA and proteins?

## Nucleic Acids
- Nucleic acids are `polymers`, like proteins.
- **Instead of being assembled from amino acids, nucleic acids are made up of `nucleotides`**.
- There are three components of a nucleotide.
  - A phosphate group.
  - A five-carbon sugar.
    - A central component in the nucleotide.
    - Five carbons in the sugar are usually labelled with numbers and prime (`'`) symbols. For example, base is attached to 1' carbon and phosphate group attached to 5' carbon.
  - A nitrogenous (contains nitrogen) base.
- Phosphate group bonds to a sugar molecule, which bonds to the base.

ribonucleotides
: monomers of RNA (ribonucleic acid). sugar is ribose.
deoxyribonucleotides
: monomers of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). sugar is deoxyribus.
*deoxy*-
: prefix for 'lacking oxygen'.

## Nitrogenous Bases
- `purines` - consist of double rings formed from nine atoms.
  - adenine (A) (note - has 'nine' in name)
  - guanine (G) (note - has 'nine' in name)
- `pyrimidines` - consist of single rings formed from six atoms.
  - cytosine (C)
  - uracil (U) (used by ribonucleotides)
  - thymine (T) (used by deoxyribonucleotides)

## Drawing Nucleotides
phosphate
: usually represented as a circle.
sugar
: usually represented as a pentagon with an upright tail.
nitrogenous base
: usually represented as a hexagon.
covalent bond
: usually represented with a line.
  
## Chemical Evolution in the Production of Nucleotides
- If nucleic acids played a role in chemical evolution of life, then there **must have been at least some nucleotides present in prebiotic oceans**.
- Most biologists _accept the idea that `amino acids` could have been synthesized early in Earth's history_.
  - Nitrogenous bases and types of sugars[^1] can be synthesized under conditions like those in early Earth oceans, particularly deep-sea hydrothermal vent systems.
    - Reactive minerals on the surface of walls in deep-sea vents **bind to ribose, effectively enriching and concentrating ribose[^2] from a pool of diverse sugars.**

## How do Nucleotides Polymerize to Form Nucleic Acids?
- **Once nucleotides formed, how would they polymerize to form nucleic acids?
- Nucleotides polymerize through `condensation reactions` between hydroxyl on sugar component of one nucleotide and phosphate group of another nucleotide.
  - *Forms a new covalent bond between the two nucleotides, and a molecule of water is released*.
- Bridge formed by phosphate group called `phosphodiester linkage` (phosophodiester bond).
- When phosphodiester linkages join ribonucleotides together, the polymer produced is RNA.
- Phosphodiester linkages between deoxyribonucleotides produces DNA.

## DNA and RNA Strands Are Directional
- A chain of linked sugars and phosphates in a nucleic acid acts as a backbone.
- The phosphate backbone of a nucleic acid is **directional**.
  - In a strand of RNA/DNA,
    - One end has an unlinked 5' phosphate
    - Another end has an unlinked 3' hydroxyl
- Order of different nucleotides forms the primary structure of the nucleic acid.
- Sequence of bases in RNA/DNA is always written in a 5' to 3' direction. 
  - This is logical; RNA and DNA are synthesized in this direction.
  - Nucleotides are only added at 3' end.

## Polymerization Requires an Energy Source
- The joining of nucleotides into nucleic acids decreases entropy and therefore **is not spontaenous**.
- Energy is needed to tip the balance _in favor of polymerization).
- Nucleic acid polymerization can take place in cells b/c potential energy of nucleotides are raised by reactions that **add +2 phosphate groups to the 5' phosphates of ribonucleoside or deoxyribonucleoside monophosphates**, which create `nucleoside triphosphates`'.
- Nucleoside triphosphates are activated nucleotides; adenosine triphosphate, `ATP`.
  - Equivalent **used in DNA synthesis**: deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP).
- Phosphates are **negatively charged**, and charges repel.
  - Linking 2 or more phosphates together creates *covalent bonds* that carry lots of potential energy.
  - Energy is released when phosphates form new, more stable bonds with *other atoms.*

# 4.2: DNA Structure and Function
- Primary structure of DNA is similar to primary strucutre of proteins.
- DNA molecules have a sugar-phosphate backbone created by phosphodiester linkages and a sequence of any of 4 bases that extend from it.
- DNA also has a secondary structure.

## The Nature of DNA's Secondary Structure
- Discovery of DNA's secondary structure was one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs of the 20th century.
- Many clues as to the structure of DNA:
  - Chemists knew the molecule had a sugar-phosphate backbone.
  - Number of purines in a DNA molecule equal to number of pyridines, #T = #A, #C = #G.
  - Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins used `X-ray crystallography` to find distances between groups of atoms in the molecule.
    - Three distances were repeated: 0.34, 2.0, 3.4 nm[^3]
    - Could infer a regular and repeating structure.

## Antiparallel Double Helix
- Watson and Crick analyzed the size and geometry of 3 nucleotide components:
  - Deoxyribose
  - Phosphate
  - Base
- Determined that:
  - the distance of 2.0 nm represented the width of the helix
  - the distance of 0.34 nm was the distance between bases stacked in a spiral
- Observations:
  - only purine-pyrimidine fits in the 2-nm wide sugar-phosphate backbone.
    - purine-purine too big, pyrimidine-pyrimidine too small
  - complimentary base pairing based on hydrogen bonding
  - patterns of hydrogen bonding could form only if bases are opposite strands flipped 180 degrees relative. These are `antiparallel`.
  - antiparallel strands predicted to form a `double helix`.
- Carbon-nitrogen rings are mostly nonpolar, although each base has polar groups for hydrogen bonds.
  - In aqueous solutions[^4], hydrophobic interactions caused DNA **to twist into a helix to minimize contact between hydrophobic base and water molecules**.
- Strands are stabilized by **base stacking**.
  - Results from van der Waals interactions between adjacent bases.
  - Rotated orientation of interior base pairs lets rings of adjacent bases stack on top of each other like coins.
  - Double helix is hydrophilic overall and soluble in aqueous solutions.
- **Major and minor grooves** allow access to proteins.

## Summary of Antiparallel Double Helix
The double helix is shaped and stabilized by hydrogen bonding between complementary base pairs, hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals interactions.

## Tertiary Structure of DNA
- DNA in cells is found in compact three-dimensional structures.
- Total length of DNA in each cell is about 6 feet long. Needs to be compact.
- When DNA becomes wound too tightly or losely, it twists on itself to form **supercoils**, which are compact and 3-dimensional structures.

## DNA as an Information-Encoding Molecule
- Watson and Crick's model revealed DNA as a biological resevoir of information.
- Information consists of a sequence of nucleotides in nucleic acid.
- Four nitrogenous bases are like letters in an alphabet.
- **DNA stores important information**.
- DNA can perform its own synthesis.
  1. Separate strand; break complementary base pairs.
    - This can be done by breaking hydrogen bonds with heat or enzyme-catalyzed reaction.
  2. Each strand of DNA serves as a template for formation of a new strand.
    - Template strand is combined with complementary strand.
  3. Strands polymerize to form sugar-pohsphate backbone.
    - Produces two identical daughter molecules.
- Does the structure of DNA allow it to be replicated?
> It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism. -Watson and Crick

## The DNA Double Helix is a Stable Structure
- DNA is highly structured; regular, symmetric, held together.
- DNA from fossils that are 10k-s of years old; they are the same sequence of bases as when they were alive.
- Stability of DNA reveals why **it is so effective as information storage**.
- Structure of DNA is simple and nonreactive; never ben observed to cataylze any reaction in any organism.
- No support for the idea that life began with DNA alone; instead, life began with RNA.
