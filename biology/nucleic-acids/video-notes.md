## Nucleic Acid Structure
- **DNA polymer** - one of two twisted stands that make up a DNA molecule.
- Cells make nucleic acid polymers by linking together **four types of monomers, called nucleotides**.
- Each nucleotide consists of a
  - Sugar (deoxyribose in DNA)
  - Phosphate group
  - Nitrogen-containing[^1] base (G, A, C, T)
- Letters in a sentence, sequence of nucleotides carries information.
- The DNA of every organism has a unique nucleotide sequence.
  - DNA can be millions of nucleotides in length.
- DNA consists of two strands of nucleotides that twist around each other.
  - This forms a double helix.
  - Strands are held together by hydrogen bonds between pairs of nitrogenous bases.
  - `A` pairs with `T`, `G` pairs with `C`.

<br>

- **RNA Polymer** - typically single-stranded.
- Instead of deoxyribose, has a sugar called ribose.
- Uses a different base (uracil, U) instead of thyamine (T).
- Copied from part from part of DNA, so shorter than DNA.
  - Dozens to thousands of nucleotides.

## Tips on Drawing DNA Sequences
- DNA molecules are large, complex, & important.
- There are many different models for DNA.
- Use models that ignore most of DNA structure, but be familiar with the basics *so you know what it represents*.
- Double-stranded DNA is **shaped like a ladder**.
  - Uprights made of **sugars** and **phosphate groups**.
  - Rungs made of nitrogenous bases that come in four varieties (G with C, A with T)
- **How is genetic information stored in DNA?**
  - Particular sequence of letters (-T-C-T-A-G-C-)
  - Thousands of letters in a sequence of gene.
  - The sequence of gene determines the physical trait.
  - If a mutation occurs, causing change in DNA sequence, the protein may change.
- Only focus on a small segment of a gene.
  - In general, plants with similar DNAs are likely to be more related.

## Tips on Drawing Nucleotides
- Molecules like nucleotides are hard to see because they are so small.
- Space-filling models are difficult to see; structural formula is better.
- Ribose
  - OH group at 2' and 3' carbon
- Deoxyribose
  - OH group at 3', H group at 2' carbon
- Simplification!
  - Leave out hydrogens and carbons, which are implied by corners of the model.
  - Sugar left to a pentagon, if different types of sugar not necessary.
  - Phosphate group as sugar connected by 5' carbon item.
  - Nitrogenous base as a hexagon with letter indicating type.
  - Simplified model useful to draw several nucleotides.

## Tips on Drawing Nucleic Acids
- DNA is a type of nucleic acid, which is a polymer of nucleotides.
- When nucleotides polymerize, a covalent bond forms between the three-prime carbon of one sugar molecule and the phosphate group of another.
- The phosphate groups and sugars form the backbone.
  - Arrowhead represents the side of the chain where the 3' carbon has a free OH group.
- In the other strand, they are reversed.
- Nitrogenous bases pair in the center and pair in a specific way.
  - One-ring cytosine form three hydrogen bonds with double-ring guanine.
  - One-ring thyamine forms three hydrogen bonds with double-ring adenine.

## ATP Hydrolysis
- What is the source of acid used for nucleic acid polymerization?
- Monomers of nucleic acids are nucleotides. Imagine them moving around in a disordered manner.
  - Nucleotides are organized by condensation reactions, become ordered.
- In spontaneous reactions:

| From | To |
| :---: | :---: |
| Reactants | Products |
| High potential energy | Low potential energy |
| Low entropy | High entropy |

- The process is not spontaneous, because entropy does not decrease.
- Nucleotide activiation is **activated with more phosphates**.
  - Each phosphate has a negative charge.
  - Repulsion between negative charges makes bonds between phosphates weak.
  - Increase potential energy.
  - Potential to form new, stronger bonds has increased.
- Condensation reactions.
  - Two phosphates are removed in one nucleotide and the remaining phosphate makes a strong bond with the 3' carbon in another nucleotide.
  - Different in bond strength releases heat.
  - Condensation reactions with activated nucleotides are spontaneous.
    - Increase in molecular motion as heat is released increases entropy.
- ATP: Adenosine Triphosphate.
  - Activated nucleotide.
  - When ATP + H2O, splits into AMP[^2] + inorganic pyrophosphate (2 phosphate molecules), which have formed stronger bonds with water.
  - Decrease in potential energy. 
  - Hydrolysis. Released as heat.

## The Double Helix
- 3-dimensional arrangement of molecules must explain stability of life (traits passed) and the mutability of life (change fo evolution to happen).
- Genes - located inside the nucleus of cells, associated with chromosomes.
- Genes needed to be made of DNA or proteins
  - DNA doesn't seem very interesting - repeated units of phosphate, sugar, and bases.
  - This view persisted for a long time.
- Powerful technique for solving molecular structure: x-ray crystallography.
  - Determine position of every single atom in the molecule with respect to every other molecule.
  - DNA is not an easy molecule to work with.
- Maurice Wilkins - trained as a physicist, drawn to problem of the gene.
  - Rosalind Franklin; talented crytallographer.
  - Recipe for disaster; worked against each other often.
- Biological molecules come in many shapes.
  - Suspected DNA might be a helix of some kind.
  - How would the bases arrange?
- Initially, Watson and Crick's the model was wrong (bases on the outside). Franklin dismissed their effort.
- Pauling preparing a copy of DNA; a triple helix similar to the one that they had been shamed in abandoning.
- Photo 51, diffraction pattern was a helix.
  - A double helix, not a triple helix.
  - The two backbones led in opposite directions.
  - The bases need to be on the inside.
- The number of As and Ts was the same, the number of Gs and Cs was the same.
- Discovered the arrangement of the bases, which revealed how DNA works.
- Complimentary nature of DNA. Could easily make a new complimentary copy just be obeying pairing rules. Solved gene replication.
- Answers how information is stored and how mutations emerge.

## RNA Folding
- When nucleic acid is relieved of being locked with another strand, it can take on any shape it wants to (does not need to be a double helix).
- RNA structues are more varied than what DNA can be.
- Can interact with itself.
- Can achieve what, for instance, a protein molecule can achieve.
- Not just an informational molecule, but a biocatalyst.
