# Textbook Notes - Protein Structure and Function

## 3.1 Amino Acids and Their Polymerization
- Modern cells produce tens of thousands of distinct proteins.
- Most molecules are composed of **just 20 different building bocks**: amino acids.
  - Share a common structure.

### The Structure of Amino Acids
- Carbon atoms have a valence of four.
  - They can form up to 4 covalent bonds.
- In all 20 amino acids, **a central carbon atom bonds covalently to 4 different groups of atoms:**
  - `H` - hydrogen atom.
  - `NH2` - amino functional group.
  - `COOH` - carboxyl functional group.
  - `R-group ('side chain')`.
- Combination of amino and carboxyl groups is key to how these molecules behave.
  - In water (`pH=7`), amino acids ionize.
