## 3.1 Amino Acids and Their Polymerization
- Modern cells produce tens of thousands of distinct proteins.
- Most molecules are composed of **just 20 different building bocks**: amino acids.
  - Share a common structure.

### The Structure of Amino Acids
- Carbon atoms have a valence of four.
  - They can form up to 4 covalent bonds.
- In all 20 amino acids, **a central carbon atom bonds covalently to 4 different groups of atoms:**
  - `H` - hydrogen atom.
  - `NH2` - amino functional group.
  - `COOH` - carboxyl functional group.
  - `R-group ('side chain')`.
- Combination of amino and carboxyl groups is key to how these molecules behave.
  - In water (`pH=7`), amino acids ionize.
    - Concentration of protons at this pH causes amino group to act as a base.
    - Attracts proton.
  - Carboxyl group acts **as an acid.**
    - Highly electronegative oxygen atoms pull electron away from hydrogen atom.
    - It is easy for this group to lose a proton.
  - The charges on these functional groups:
    - Keep amino acids in solution, where they can interact with each other.
    - Affect amino acid's chemical reactivity.

### The Nature of Side Chains
- `R-group` or `side chain` represents part of amino acid core structure that makes each of the 20 amino acids unique.
  - `R-grops` vary from single hydrogen atom to large structures.
- Properties of amino acids vary because `R-groups` vary.

#### Functional Groups Affect Reactivity
- Several of side chains in amino acids contain `carboxyl`, `sulfhydryl`, `hydroxyl`, or amino functional groups.
  - Functional groups can participate in chemical reactions.
- **Example:** amino acids with sulfhydryl group (`-SH`) in their side chains can form disulfide (`S-S`) bonds that help link different parts of large proteins.
  - Bonds form between proteins in hair.
- Some amino acids contain side chains with no functional groups.
  - Consist of only `C` and `H` atoms.
  - Rarely participate in chemical reactions.
- **Influence of amino acids on protein function determined primarily by size and shape rather than reactivity.**

#### Polarity and Charge of R-Groups Affect Solubility
- Nature of `R-group` affects solubility of an amino acid.
  - Polar and electrically charged `R-groups` interact with water and are **hydrophilic**.
  - Nonpolar `R-groups` lack charged or highly electronegative atoms to form hydrogen bonds withw ater. These are **hydrophobic.**

#### Categorizing Amino Acid R-Groups
- Amino acid `R-groups` are divided into three types:
- **charged**, acidic and basic;
- **uncharged polar**;
- **nonpolar**.
- Ask these four questions:
  1. Does the `R-group` have a negative charge? If so, it is **acidic** and has lost a proton.
  2. Does the `R-group` have a positive charge? If so, it is **basic** and has gained a proton.
  3. If the `R-group` is uncharged, does it have an oxygen atom? If so, the electronegative oxygen will form polar covalent bond in the `R-group`, making it **uncharged polar**.
  4. If the `R-group` does not have a charge or an oxygen atom, it is **nonpolar**.

### How Amino Acids Link to Form Proteins
- Amino acids polymerize when a bond forms between **carboxyl group** of one amino acid and **amino group** of another.
- `C-N` covalent bond that results from condensation reaction is **peptide bond**.
