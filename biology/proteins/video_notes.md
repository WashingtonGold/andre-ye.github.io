## Protein Structure
- Most proteins are folded into a complex, globular shape.
- Each protein consists of one or more chains of amino acid minomers.
  - Linked by peptide bonds.
  - Protein polymer often known as `polypeptides`.
- Proteins are very complex, so described in **4 layers of structure**.

### Primary Structure
  - Each protein has a unique primary structure.
    - Number and sequence of amino acids, making up the polypeptide chain.
    - 20 amino acids are used to build proteins.
    - Various amino acids could be linked in almost any sequence.
  - Structure of a single amino acid:
    - Same backbone: amino group, `C`, `H`, carboxyl group
    - `R` group that projects out from the backbone unique.
      - This makes each of the 20 amino acids unique.
      - Affects folding of the protein.
      
### Secondary Structure
  - Parts of the polypeptide chain are folded or coiled.
  - Examples:
    - Alpha helix - chain twists forms a helix.
    - Beta pleated - chain folds back on itself, or two regions lie parallel.
  - Results from hydrogen bonding between atoms of the polypeptide backbone.
    - `O` and `N` along the backbone are highly electronegativity.
    - Bound to `H`; are attracted to each other at regular intervals.
    - Part of the protein twists on itself.
    
### Tertiary Structure
  - Superimposed on primary and secondary structure: irregular loops and folds that give the protein its 3d shape.
  - Results from interactions along R groups.
    - Basic & Acidic groups ionize.
      - Can form ionic bonds.
    - Hydrophilic or polar `R`-groups may hydrogen bond with each other or turn outwards and bond with surrounding water.
    - Hydrophobic or nonpolar `R` groups cluster on the inside of the protein, away from water.
    - Furhter stabalized by sulfur-containing strong covalent bonds.
    
### Quaternary Structure
  - Some proteins are made up multiple polypeptide chains.
  - Results from combination of two or more polypeptide subunites.
  - Stabilized by same interactions that stabalize tertiary structure.
  - For example: hemoglobin (oxygen carrying protein of blood)
    - 2 Alpha chains
    - 2 Beta chains

## Protein Functions and Types
- Proteins are the most complicated molecules known.
- A cell contains thousands of types of proteins.
  - These carry out different functions.
- Each protein's function is determined by its 3-dimensional structure.
  - Function depends on shape and changes in shape.

### Structural Proteins
- Anchor cell parts
- Serve as tracks along which cell parts can move
- Bind cells together to form muscles, ligaments, etc.
- Examples:
  - Major Ampullate Spidroin Protein makes the black widow spider web.
  - Collagen strengthens bones, cartilage, tendons, ligaments, and skin.

### Signal Proteins
- Hormonal proteins that coordinate an organism's activity by acting as a signal between cells.
- **Insulin** signals an animal's cells to take in sugar.
- Hormone receptor is also a protein.
- Signal molecules bond with receptor proteins to deliver messages.
- Some signal molecules are also proteins.
- Examples
  - Adrenergic receptor activated by non-protein hormone (adrenaline) in times of stress. Signals heart cells to beat faster and liver cells to release glucose.
  - Insulin released into blood stream after meal. Activates insular receptor, which signals muscle and fat cells to store blood sugar.

### Transport Proteins
- Carry molecules from place to place.
- Allows certain solute molecules to enter the cell.
- Examples:
- Cytochrome C proteins form one protein complex to another, generating energy to power the cell.
  - Hemoglobin is the transport protein that carries oxygen in the blood.


### Sensory Proteins
- Detect environmental signals like light.
- Respond by emitting signals to call for a response.
- Examples:
  - TRPA1 Protein in rattlesnake's pit organ senses body heat.
  - Cryptochrome proteins in monarch butterflies sense Earth's magnetic field.

### Enzyme Proteins
- A protein that changes the rate of a chemical reaction without itself being changed into a different molecule in the process.
- Control and regulate all chemical reactions.
- **Build and break down molecules.**
- Critical for growth, digestion, and other processes.
  - Without enzymes, chemical reactions would happen to slowly to sustain life.
- Examples:
  - Lactase helps infants digest lactose.
  - Luciferase makes fireflies grow and controls a chemical reaction that gives off light.
  - DNA polymerase builds DNA molecules. Reads old DNA strand and inserts correct nucleotides into the new strand.

### Storage Proteins
- Stockpile materials used to make other proteins. Store nutrient and energy-rich molecules for later use.
- Examples:
  - Main substance in egg white (Ovalbumin) serves as a storage protein for developing chicken embryos. 
  - Glucose is a storage protein in seeds of wheat, barley, and rye.

### Contractile (Motor) Proteins
- Move parts of a cell.
- Proteins working together in muscle groups can move an entire animal.
- Examples:
  - To contract muscle cells, millions of myosin motors slide along chains of actin proteins.

### Gene Regulatory Proteins
- Bind to DNA in particular locations and control whether certain genes will be read.
- Allows cells to be specialized to certain functions.
- Examples:
  - p53 protein prevents cell from dividing when DNA is damaged.
  - Androgen and estrogen receptors control genes that trigger puberty.

### Defensive Proteins
- Defensive proteins help organisms fight infection, heal damaged tissue, and evade predators.
- Examples:
  - Antibodies bind to invaders like viruses and mark foreign objects for destruction.
  - Fibrin proteins form blood clots and scabs at the wound site. Plugs a wound and stops bleeding.
