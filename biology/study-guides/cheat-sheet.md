## Famous Experiments

### Herschey-Chase Experiment
| Aspect | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Question | Do viral genes consist of DNA or protein? |
| DNA Hypothesis | T2 virus genes consist of DNA. |
| Protein Hypothesis | T2 virus genes consist of protein. |
| Experimental Setup | Label viruses (grow one set of TS w/ radioactive DNA and radioactive protein). Infect bacteria. Agitate cultures. Centrifuge solutions and force cells into pellet. Record location of radioactive labels. |
| Prediction of DNA Hypothesis | Radioactive DNA will be located within the pellet. |
| Prediction of Protein Hypothesis | Radioactive protein will be located within the pellet. |
| Results | Radioactive DNA is in pellet. Radioactive protein is in solution. |
| Conclusion | T2 virus genes consist of DNA. |

### Meselson-Stahl Experiment

| Aspect | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Question | Is replication semiconservative, conservative, or dispersive? |
| Hypothesis 1 | Replication is conservative. |
| Hypothesis 2 | Replication is semiconservative. |
| Hypothesis 3 | Replication is dispersive. |
| Experimental Setup | Grow *E. coli* cells in medium with `15_N`. Transfer cells to medium with `14_N`. Let the cells divide twice (total 3 generations). Centrifuge the three samples separately. Compare locations of DNA bands.
| Prediction 1 | After two generations: 1/2 low-density DNA, 1/2 intermediate-density DNA. |
| Prediction 2 | 1/4 high-density DNA, 3/4 low-density DNA. |
| Prediction 3 | All intermediate-density DNA. |
| Results | After 2 generations, 1/2 low-density DNA and 1/2 intermediate-density DNA. |
| Conclusion | Replication is semiconservative. |

## Terms and Concepts

### DNA

#### 3 DNA Replication Hypotheses

Hypothesis | Description
--- | ---
Semiconservative replication | If parental strands of DNA separate, each could be used as a synthesis of a new daughter strand. Each daughter DNA molecule consists of one old strand and one new strand. Conserves only one of the strands.
Conservative replication | If bases of strands turned out from the helix, they could serve as a template for an entirely new double helix all at once.
Dispersive replication | Parental double helix was fragmented into small pieces before replication, and each piece was replicated either with conservative or semiconservative mechanisms. Fragments would be joined into two molecules that contained a mixture of parental and daughter strands.

#### DNA Replication Terms and Concepts

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Chromosome theory of inheritance | Proposed that chromosomes contain genes. |
| Nitrogen 14 | Normal nitrogen; used in the Meselson-Stahl experiment to distinguish parent strands from daughter strands. |
| Nitrogen 15 | Heavy nitrogen with one more neutron; used in the Meselson-Stahl experiment to distinguish parent strands from daughter strands. |
| 5' to 3' Direction | The direction in which DNA is synthesized. |
| Antiparallel strands | Strands of DNA that lie opposite each other. |
| Complementary base pairing | Base A matched with base T, base G matches with base C. |
| Density gradient centrifugation | Separates molecules based on their density. Lower-density molecules cluster in bands high in the centrifuge tube, higher-density molecules cluster in bands lower in the tube. |
| dNTP | DNA synthesis requires an input of energy, but potential energy of deoxyribonucleotide monomers is raiased by reactions tha add two phosphate groups, forming deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs). dNTP has high potential energy; forms phosphodiester bonds in DNA strand. |
| Discontinuous Replication | Proposed to explain how lagging strand was synthesized. Primase synthesizes new RNA primers for lagging strands as the moving replication fork opens single-stranded regions of DNA; DNA polymerase syntheses short DNA fragments from these primers. Fragments linked to form a continuous strand. |
| Lagging strand | The strand that runs opposite to the direction in which the replication fork is moving. This causes a lag. |
| Continuous strand | The strand that moves in the same direction as the replication fork. |
| Okazaki fragments | Short DNA fragments attached to RNA primers produced by the lag of the lagging strnad. |
| Origin of Replication | A sequence of bases that indicates the start of a replication bubble, in which two replication forks move in opposite directions to separate the DNA strand. | Proteins and enzymes work in a macromolecular machine called the replisome. Replisome may contain up to three copies of DNA polymerase III.
| RNA polymerase | A polymerase that can start synthesis from scratch. Primase is a RNA polymerase (enzymes that catalyze polymerization of ribonucleotides into RNA). |
| RNA primers | Because DNA polymerase cannot synthesize new nucleotides on its onw, but RNA polymerase (for example, primase) can. This is used to initiate building, and is later removed by DNA polymerase I. |


### Proteins

#### Proteins Required for Synthesis in Bacteria

| Purpose | Name | Function |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Opening the helix | Helicase | Catalyzes the separation of DNA strands to open the double helix. Breaks hydrogen bonds. |
| Opening the helix | Single-strand DNA-binding Proteins (SSBPs) | Stabilizes single-stranded DNA. |
| Opening the helix | Topoisomerase | Breaks and rejoins the DNA double helix by breaking phosphodiester bonds to relieve twisting forces caused by the opening of the helix. |
| Leading-strand synthesis | Primase | Catalyzes the synthesis of the RNA primer. |
| Leading-strand synthesis | DNA Polymerase III | Extends the leading strand. |
| Leading-strand synthesis | Sliding clamp | Holds DNA in place during strand extention. |
| Lagging-strand synthesis | Primase | Catalyzes the synthesis of the RNA primer on the Okazaki fragment. |
| Lagging-strand synthesis | DNA Polymerase III | Extends an Okazaki fragment. |
| Lagging-strand synthesis | Sliding clamp | Holds DNA polymerase in place during strand extention. |
| Lagging-strand synthesis | DNA Polymerase I | Removes the RNA primer and replaces it with DNA. |
| Lagging-strand synthesis | DNA ligase | Catalyzes the jooining of Okazaki fragments into a continuous strand. |
