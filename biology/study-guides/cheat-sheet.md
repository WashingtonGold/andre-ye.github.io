## Famous Experiments

### Miller-Urey Experiment

| Aspect | Description |
| --- | -------------------- |
| Question | Can simple molecules and kinetic energy lead to chemical evolution? |
| Hypothesis | Chemical evolution of organic molecules will occur in environments simulating early Earth conditions. |
| Null Hypothesis | Chemical evolution will not occur in early Earth simulations. |
| Prediction of Hypothesis | If kinetic energy is added to a mix of simple molecules, complex organic compounds will be produced. |
| Prediction of Null Hypothesis | No complex organic compounds will be produced. |
| Results | Samples from solution contained formaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, and several complex compounds with C=C bonds, like amino acids (e.g. glycine). |
| Conclusion | Chemical evolution occurs readily if simple molecules with high free energy are exposed to a source of kinetic energy. |
| Significance | Paved the idea for foundation for ideas of chemical evolution and sparked further experiments. |


### Herschey-Chase Experiment

| Aspect | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Question | Do viral genes consist of DNA or protein? |
| DNA Hypothesis | T2 virus genes consist of DNA. |
| Protein Hypothesis | T2 virus genes consist of protein. |
| Experimental Setup | Label viruses (grow one set of TS w/ radioactive DNA and radioactive protein). Infect bacteria. Agitate cultures. Centrifuge solutions and force cells into pellet. Record location of radioactive labels. |
| Prediction of DNA Hypothesis | Radioactive DNA will be located within the pellet of the centrifuge. |
| Prediction of Protein Hypothesis | Radioactive protein will be located within the pellet of the centrifuge. |
| Results | Radioactive DNA is in pellet. Radioactive protein is in solution. |
| Conclusion | T2 virus genes consist of DNA. |
| Significance | Proved that heritable information takes the form of DNA, not proteins. |

### Meselson-Stahl Experiment

| Aspect | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Question | Is replication semiconservative, conservative, or dispersive? |
| Hypothesis 1 | Replication is conservative. |
| Hypothesis 2 | Replication is semiconservative. |
| Hypothesis 3 | Replication is dispersive. |
| Experimental Setup | Grow *E. coli* cells in medium with `15_N` (heavy nitrogen, see [DNA Replication Terms and Concepts](#dna-replication-terms-and-concepts)). Transfer cells to medium with `14_N` (regular nitrogen). Let the cells divide twice (total 3 generations). Centrifuge the three samples separately. Compare locations of DNA bands.
| Prediction 1 | After two generations: 1/2 low-density DNA, 1/2 intermediate-density DNA. |
| Prediction 2 | 1/4 high-density DNA, 3/4 low-density DNA. |
| Prediction 3 | All intermediate-density DNA. |
| Results | After 2 generations, 1/2 low-density DNA and 1/2 intermediate-density DNA. |
| Conclusion | Replication is semiconservative. |
| Significance | Proved that, in accordance with Watson and Crick's suspicions, that DNA replicated by splitting down the middle and using each half as a template. Thus, each DNA is half-old and half-new. |

## Terms and Concepts

### Chemistry

#### Chemical Foundation of Life Terms and Concepts

| Term | Definition |
| --- | ------- |
| Atom | the smallest identifiable unit of matter. |
| Element | a substance that consists entirely of a single type of atom. |
| Isotope | forms of an element with different numbers of neutrons. |
| Atomic Number | characteristic number of protons in an atom. |
| Mass Number | sum of protons and neutrons in an atom. |
| Covalent Bond | when two atoms share electrons, and the connected atoms form a molecule. Make the atoms more stable, often complete shells. |
| Compound | atoms of different elements are bonded together. |
| Electronegativity | when atoms of different elements bond, they may pull electrons towards their nuclei with different strengths. |
| Nonpolar Covalent Bond | a bond that involves equally shared electrons. |
| Polar Covalent Bond | a bond that involves assymetrically shared electrons. |
| Ionic Bond | electrons in ionic bonds are completely transferred from one atom to another. |
| Solvent | an agent for dissolving, or getting substances into solution. |

### Origin of Life

#### Two Theories

| Theory | Process |
| --- | ------------------ |
| Prebiotic Soup Model | Simple molecules like `N2`, `NH3`, and `CO` were present in the atmosphere of ancient earth. Energy in sunlight drove reactions among simple molecules to produce molecules like `formaldehyde` and `hydrogen cyanide`. Stimulated by heat, the products formed more complex molecules like `ribose`, `glycine`, and `acetaldehyde`. |
| Surface Metabolism Model | Simple molecules like `N2`, `NH3`, and `CO` were present in early oceans and hydrothermal events. Vent minerals catalyzed spontaneous reactions among high-energy molecules to produce, for instance, `acetic acid`. Concentration and heat formed more complex molecules like ribose.

### RNA

#### RNA vs DNA Levels of Structure

| Level of Structure | DNA | RNA |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Primary | Sequence of deoxyribonucleotides: bases are A, T, G, C | Sequence of ribonucleotides: bases are A, U, G, C |
| Secondary | Two antiparallel strands twist into a double helix, stabilized by hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals interactions | Single strand folds back on itself to form a double-helical 'stem' and an unpaired 'loop'. |
| Tertiary | Double helical DNA forms compact structures by wrapping around histone proteins or twisting into supercoils. | Secondary structures fold to form a wide variety of distinctive three-dimensional shape. |

### DNA

#### 3 DNA Replication Hypotheses

Hypothesis | Description
--- | ---
Semiconservative replication | If parental strands of DNA separate, each could be used as a synthesis of a new daughter strand. Each daughter DNA molecule consists of one old strand and one new strand. Conserves only one of the strands.
Conservative replication | If bases of strands turned out from the helix, they could serve as a template for an entirely new double helix all at once.
Dispersive replication | Parental double helix was fragmented into small pieces before replication, and each piece was replicated either with conservative or semiconservative mechanisms. Fragments would be joined into two molecules that contained a mixture of parental and daughter strands.

#### DNA Replication Terms and Concepts

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Chromosome theory of inheritance | Proposed that chromosomes contain genes. |
| Nitrogen 14 | Normal nitrogen; used in the Meselson-Stahl experiment to distinguish parent strands from daughter strands. |
| Nitrogen 15 | Heavy nitrogen with one more neutron; used in the Meselson-Stahl experiment to distinguish parent strands from daughter strands. |
| 5' to 3' Direction | The direction in which DNA is synthesized. |
| Antiparallel strands | Strands of DNA that lie opposite each other. |
| Complementary base pairing | Base A matched with base T, base G matches with base C. |
| Density gradient centrifugation | Separates molecules based on their density. Lower-density molecules cluster in bands high in the centrifuge tube, higher-density molecules cluster in bands lower in the tube. |
| dNTP | DNA synthesis requires an input of energy, but potential energy of deoxyribonucleotide monomers is raiased by reactions tha add two phosphate groups, forming deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs). dNTP has high potential energy; forms phosphodiester bonds in DNA strand. |
| Discontinuous Replication | Proposed to explain how lagging strand was synthesized. Primase synthesizes new RNA primers for lagging strands as the moving replication fork opens single-stranded regions of DNA; DNA polymerase syntheses short DNA fragments from these primers. Fragments linked to form a continuous strand. |
| Lagging strand | The strand that runs opposite to the direction in which the replication fork is moving. This causes a lag. |
| Continuous strand | The strand that moves in the same direction as the replication fork. |
| Okazaki fragments | Short DNA fragments attached to RNA primers produced by the lag of the lagging strnad. |
| Origin of Replication | A sequence of bases that indicates the start of a replication bubble, in which two replication forks move in opposite directions to separate the DNA strand. | 
| Replisome | Proteins and enzymes work in a macromolecular machine called the replisome. Replisome may contain up to three copies of DNA polymerase III.
| RNA polymerase | A polymerase that can start synthesis from scratch. Primase is a RNA polymerase (enzymes that catalyze polymerization of ribonucleotides into RNA). |
| RNA primers | Because DNA polymerase cannot synthesize new nucleotides on its onw, but RNA polymerase (for example, primase) can. This is used to initiate building, and is later removed by DNA polymerase I. |


### Proteins

#### Protein Levels of Structure

| Level of Structure | Description | Stabilized by |
| --- | --- |
| Primary | Each protein has a unique primary structure, determined by the number and sequence of amino acids, making up the polypeptide chain. 20 amino acids are used to build proteins. Various amino acids could be linked in almost any sequence. | Peptide bonds |
| Secondary | Parts of the polypeptide chain are folded or coiled. For example, forms alpha helix - chain twists forms a helix or beta pleated sheats - chain folds back on itself, or two regions lie parallel. Results from hydrogen bonding between atoms of the polypeptide backbone. | Hydrogen bonding between groups along the peptide-bonded backbone |
| Tertiary | Superimposed on primary and secondary structure: irregular loops and folds that give the protein its 3d shape. Results from interactions along R groups - hydrophilic or polar `R`-groups may hydrogen bond with each other or turn outwards and bond with surrounding water and hydrophobic or nonpolar `R` groups cluster on the inside of the protein, away from water. | Bonds and other interactions between R-groups or between R-groups and a peptide-bonded backbone; sulfur-containing strong covalent bonds |
| Quaternary | Some proteins are made up multiple polypeptide chains. Results from combination of two or more polypeptide | Same interactions that stabilize tertiary structure. |
