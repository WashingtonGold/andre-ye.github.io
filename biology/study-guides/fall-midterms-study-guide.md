- **Electronegativities:** `O > N > S = C = H = P`.

| Term | Definition |
| --- | ------- |
| Atom | the smallest identifiable unit of matter. |
| Element | a substance that consists entirely of a single type of atom. |
| Isotope | forms of an element with different numbers of neutrons. |
| Atomic Number | characteristic number of protons in an atom. |
| Mass Number | sum of protons and neutrons in an atom. |
| Covalent Bond | when two atoms share electrons, and the connected atoms form a molecule. Make the atoms more stable, often complete shells. |
| Compound | atoms of different elements are bonded together. |
| Electronegativity | when atoms of different elements bond, they may pull electrons towards their nuclei with different strengths. |
| Nonpolar Covalent Bond | a bond that involves equally shared electrons. |
| Polar Covalent Bond | a bond that involves assymetrically shared electrons. |
| Ionic Bond | electrons in ionic bonds are completely transferred from one atom to another. |
| Solvent | an agent for dissolving, or getting substances into solution. |
