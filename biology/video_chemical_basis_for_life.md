## Structure of the Atomic Nucleus
- Five important atoms: Hydrogen, Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Chlorine.
- Protons are positively charged.
- Electrons are negatively charged.
- Each atom has the unique number of protons.
```Protons + Neutrons = Mass Number```
- Most elements have two or more isotopes whose atoms differ in both mass number and neutral number.


## Electron Arrangement
- A cloud of negatively charged electrons surrounds the nucleus.
- In an uncharged atoms, **the number of electrons = the number of protons**.
- Electrons occupy energy levels called energy shells.
  - Innermost shell can hold at most two electrons, the next few shells can hold up to 8 electrons apiece.
  - The chemical properties of an atom depends on the # of electrons in its outermost electron shell.
  - An atom is most stable when its outermost shell is full.
  - Two electrons for hydrogen, eight election for larger items
- By transfering or sharing electrons, atoms can complete their outer shells and bond.

## Covalent Bonds
- A covalent bond is the sharing of outer-shell electrons by two atoms.
- E.g. Hydrogen has one electron but needs 2 complete its outer shell.
  - `H-H` covalent bond can be formed; each atom shares the other electron. The outer shell is completed.
- Other examples: CH4 (Methane), O2 (Oxygen), H2O (Water)

## Nonpolar and Polar Molecules
- **Electronegativity** - tendency for atoms to pull electrons towards themselves.
- In a covalent bond H-H, both nuclei have the same electronegativity. This is **nonpolar**.
- In a covalent bond H2O, the nucleus of oxygen attracts the electrons more; it 'hogs' it. 
  - Therefore, electrons spend more time around the oxygen molecule than the hydrogen molecules.
  - The oxygen molecule has a partial negative charge (electrons are negative).
  - The hydrogen molecules have a partial positive charge.
- Think: polar = skewed, drastically contrasting (poles).
  - If two atoms have same electronegativity, not polar
  - If two atoms have different electronegativity, is polar
- Think: electronegativity = magnet, the strength depends on the strength of the magnet itself as well as how far the object is from the magnet.

## Ionic Bonds
- Sometimes, atoms complete their outer shells by stealing or giving away atoms instead of sharing them.
- `ions` are formed when atoms lose or gain an electron to complete their shells.
- Electrical implications of ions
  - If an atom *loses* an electron, it has a positive charge (it lost a negatively-charged electrion).
  - If an atom *gains* an electron, it has a negative charge (it gained a negatively-charged electron.)

## Hydrogen Bonds
- Water molecules tend to stick together.
- Covalent bonds between hydrogen and oxygen atoms are polar
  - Share electrons unequally
- Remember that in H2O water molecule:
  - Hydrogen molecule has slight positive charge
  - Oxygen molecule has slight negative charge
- If we have two hydrogen molecules `A` and `B`:
  - The oxygen molecule of `B` will attract to the hydrogen molecule of `A`
  - This is called a `hydrogen bond`.
  - We can continue stacking up several weak covalent bonds through it being polar (uneven).
- Many biological processes require on hydrogen bonds.
  - Keeps proteins folded in a three-dimensional shape.
  - Two strands of DNA held together by hydrogen bonds.

## The Polarity of Water
- Water has many properties
  - Takes lots of heat energy to change water
  - Individual water molecules are polar and stick together by hydrogen bonds
- Atoms in H2O are in a constant 'tug-of-war' for electrons.
- The polarity of water keeps it attracted to each other (hydrogen bonds)
- Each molecule can hydrogen bond to four other molecules
  - 2 unpaired electrons in oxygen atom
  - 1 unpaired electron in each hydrogen atom
- This gives water special properties like:
  - High boiling point
  - Surface tension
