## Habits of Mind of Academic Writers
1. **Inquiring**. Begin with questions that lead to rich and complex insights.
2. **Seeking and valuing complexity**. Reject binary thinking, think from a multitude of perspectives, and accept uncertainty.
3. **Understanding academic writing is a conversation**. Build upon others' contributions and engage in dialogue.
4. **Understanding that writing is a process**. No piece of writing is ever fully completed; continuously draft and revise.
5. **Reflecting**. Don't lose the greater picture and rethink what you read and write.

## Steps of a Rhetorical Analysis

3. **Identify the writer's claims.** What are their main and supporting claims?
4. **Identify appeals to ethos, pathos, and logos.** Which methods does the author use to convince the reader?
5. **Identify thr writer's audience.** Who is the writer aiming to convince? What is their target audience?

## Steps to Writing a Paraphrase
1. **Decide whether to paraphrase.** Do you need to summarize or quote?
2. **Understand the passage.** Identify key words, phrases, and ideas.
3. **Draft your paraphrase.** Replace key words and phrases with synonyms or alternative phrases. Experiment with word order and sentence structure.
4. **Acknowledge your source.** Protect yourself from plagiarism charges.

## Steps to Writing a Summary
1. **Describe the author's key claims.** What are their main ideas?
2. **Select examples to illustrate the author's argument.** How do they justify their ideas with evidence?
3. **Present the gist of the author's argument.** What is the intersection of their ideas and purpose?
4. **Contextualize what you summarize.** Where was the piece written? What is the conversation the writing is entering?

## Identifying Types of Claims
