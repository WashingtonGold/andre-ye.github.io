## Habits of Mind of Academic Writers
1. **Inquiring**. Begin with questions that lead to rich and complex insights.
2. **Seeking and valuing complexity**. Reject binary thinking, think from a multitude of perspectives, and accept uncertainty.
3. **Understanding academic writing is a conversation**. Build upon others' contributions and engage in dialogue.
4. **Understanding that writing is a process**. No piece of writing is ever fully completed; continuously draft and revise.
5. **Reflecting**. Don't lose the greater picture and rethink what you read and write.

## Reading and Understanding

### Steps of a Rhetorical Analysis
1. **Identify the situation.** What motivates the writer? What conversation are they entering?
2. **Identify the writer's purpose.** What does the writer aim to make readers do or think about?
3. **Identify the writer's claims.** What are their main and supporting claims?
4. **Identify appeals to ethos, pathos, and logos.** Which methods does the author use to convince the reader?
5. **Identify the writer's audience.** Who is the writer aiming to convince? What is their target audience?

### Steps to Writing a Paraphrase
1. **Decide whether to paraphrase.** Do you need to summarize or quote?
2. **Understand the passage.** Identify key words, phrases, and ideas.
3. **Draft your paraphrase.** Replace key words and phrases with synonyms or alternative phrases. Experiment with word order and sentence structure.
4. **Acknowledge your source.** Protect yourself from plagiarism charges.

### Steps to Writing a Summary
1. **Describe the author's key claims.** What are their main ideas?
2. **Select examples to illustrate the author's argument.** How do they justify their ideas with evidence?
3. **Present the gist of the author's argument.** What is the intersection of their ideas and purpose?
4. **Contextualize what you summarize.** Where was the piece written? What is the conversation the writing is entering?

## Arguments and Claims

### Identifying Types of Claims
- **Claims of Fact** are assertions that define, classify, or establish that a problem or condition has, does, or will exist.
- **Claims of Value** are an evaluation of a problem or condition that has, does, or will exist.
- **Claims of Policy** are an argument that a condition *should* exist; a call for change or solution to a problem.

### Steps to Analyzing an Argument
1. **Identify the type of claim.** Is it a claim of fact? Value? Policy?
2. **Analyze the reasons used to support the claim.** Are they recent? Relevant? Reliable? Accurate?
3. **Identify concessions.** Is there another argument that even the author acknowledges is legitimate?
4. **Identify counterarguments.** What arguments contradict or challenge the authorâ€™s position?

### Rogerian Approach to Argument
1. Convey to readers that their different views are understood.
2. Acknowledge conditions under which that view is valid.
3. Assist the reader in finding common ground.
4. Create mutually acceptable solutions on clearly defined problems.

### 15 Types of Logical Fallacies
1. **Erroneous Appeal to Authority.** Author claims to be an authority but is not.
2. **Ad Hominem.** Focusing on the person making the claim, not the claim itself.
3. **Shifting the Issue.** Author draws attention away from the issue instead of offering evidence.
4. **Either/Or Fallacy.** Author will take two extreme positions and force the reader to make a choice.
5. **Sweeping Generalizations.** Author attempts to draw a conclusion without providing sufficient evidence.
6. **Bandwagon.** Author uses support of others to justify your support.
7. **Begging the Question.** Asks readers to accept a premise that is also the conclusion.
8. **False Analogy.** Persuading that something is true by using a comparison that is not reasonable.
9. **Technical Jargon.** Boosting up the author's credibility artificially by using esoteric words.
10. **Confusing Cause and Effect.** Difficult to establish one factor influenced another.
11. **Appeal to Fear.** Appealing to irrational fears and prejudices.
12. **Fallacy of Division.** Assumes wwhat is true of a whole must always be true of its parts.
13. **Hasty Generalization.** Draws a conclusion about a group with a sample size too small.
14. **Straw Man Argument.** Makes a generalization about a group without actually citing a specific writer or work.
15. **Fallacy of the Middle Ground.** Assumes that the middle position beteen extreme positions must be correct.
