## Opening Thoughts
- A student deserved a B-, or even a C+.
- Depicts a difficult struggle won over by generosity.
- Gave the student a B.
- Student responded: "low grade".

## Personal Experience and Introduction of Problem
- When author attended Tufts in 1960s, a B in courses was "something I could only dream about." `(para. 3)`
  - *Personal experience - ethos and credibility.* Establishes control as an authoritative source.
- Grade inflation, raise in GPAs beginning in the 1960s, leaves many students regarding B as negative.
- Academic leaders are willing to speak against grade inflation but few have acted against it.

> Under the current system at a lot of schools, there is no way to recognize the difference between an outstanding job and a good job. Grade inflation hides laziness on the part of the students, and as long as it exists, even faculty who want to do a good job [in grading] donâ€™t feel they can. -US Senator Hank Brown

## Fears of Combatting Grade Inflation
- "Tough grading" may trigger poor student evaluations. `(para. 5)`
  - This could jeopardize academic career track.
- Cites Duke University professor Stuart Rojstaczer:
  - Needed to reduce expectations on workload and increase grades to have students leave classes with positive impressions.
  - Teaching worse: positive student response.
  
## Harvard University and University of Massachusetts Amherst as a Case Study
- Harvard University - "poster for academic prestige."
  - 15% of Harvard students got > B+ in 1950.
  - 2007, more than half of all Harvard students in A range.
- University of Massachusetts Amherst
  - Average GPA in 2007 was 3.19, up from 3.02.
  - **Counterargument:** 'modest increase' reflects better students.
- Establishes quantitatively that grades have been increasing.
  - Next, questions whether they *should* have increased.

## The Counterargument to "More Qualified Students" Rebuttal
- The profile of the population has changed over time.
  - Smarter students get higher grades.
  - "is it that simple?" - acknowledges and questions the counterargument.
- Anecdotal evidence
  - Faculty members and administrators privately say colleges are unwilling to challenge and maybe offend students without tough grades.
  - Faculty members yield to whining students.
- Princeton University - a rebuttal.
  - In 2004, Princeton directed that As account for less than 35% of undergraduate course grades.
  - From 2004 to 2007, As accounted for 40.6% percent of undergraduate course grades, down from 47% in 2001-2004 period.
- Wellesley College (para. 9)
  - Average grade dictated to be no higher than a B+.
  - Not trying to get grades down, trying to get them to mean something.
  - Feel from 3.4 to 3.3
  > The A has really become the mark of excellence,which is what it should be. -Adele Wolfson, Associate Dean of college.
- The problem is that these policies are exceptions, and that grade inflation should be reduced through consistent prodding.
  - Public denial, private concern. 

## [Analysis] Why the Counterargument is Flawed
- *This doesn't prove anything.* Primack does not actually provide a quantitative argument against the 'more qualified students' rebuttal.
  - He uses anectodal evidence to state one reason why colleges may be unwilling to change.
  - Uses **begging the question** fallacy and **shifting the issue** fallacy.
    - If Princeton dictated that < 35% of grades would be As, then of course grades would go down. What does that prove?
    - This is avoiding the issue at hand: **what is causing a grade increase?**
- Primack doesn't rebuke anything.
  - He presents the opposing argument but uses anecdotal evidence to cover all of it.
  - He takes for granted that rising grades are a *problem*, not the profile of a more educated population.
