## The Beginning
- Beginning: 6 years ago, student union of a small liberal arts college.
- History of grades at that institution in the past 30 years.
> Grades were up. Way up. (para 2)

## Initial Data Claim
- Created a site, [https://gradeinflation.com](https://gradeinflation.com).
- Claim of fact: grades began to shoot up in the 1960s, leveled off in the 1970s, and began rising again in the 1980s.
- Although private schools had higher grades, everyone experienced grade inflation.

## Today's Grade Inflation Problem
- **Grades continue to go up regardless of quality of education.**
- Average GPA at public schools is 3.0.
  - Flagship state schools have average GPA @ >3.2.
  - Some schools, reaches 3.5 or even 3.6.
  > A is the average at those schools. (para 5)
- Brown university: 2/3 of all letter grades are As.

## The Influence on Learning
- Students walk into a classroom knowing they can "go through the motions and get a B+ or better" (para 6).
  - Classrooms filled with students who do not prepare for class.
  - *Makes a jump in declaring this.*
- Students study less than 10 hours a week, less than half the hours they spent studying 40 years ago.
  - *Does not cite this study.*
- Value judgement: students are spending more on an education that delivers less content.
- Boredom sets in.
  - Students drink.
  - Cites survey of 30,000 first-year students across the country showed nearly half spending more hours drinking than studying.
  - Uses this to develop fear and urgency.

## Solutions
- Grade inflation is a complicated issue and "no easy fix".
- Princeton University.
  - Limit As to average of 35% of students in a class.
  - Grades are coming down and academic rigor is back.
- Cites Wellesley College in Massachusetts and Reed College in Oregon.
- *Acknowledges is a complicated issue, but these solutions have worked (and there are still questions about efficacy) on only 3 schools.*
- Two major steps towards solution:
  1. School officials must admit there is a problem.
  2. Must implement policies and guidelines to restore excellence.

## Final Appeal
Making the decision to reduce grade inflation is difficult but worthwhile. The alternative is a student body that barely studies and drinks from boredom.

## Questions
- Why does he assume drinking is because of boredom, which he correlates with rising grades on average?
- Could lowering grades also provoke a drinking issue?
- Could grades be an indicator of a generally more educated population?
- Could grades be an indicator of an easier curriculum?
  - In this case, is his proposed solution fair?
- Why decide 35%? What if a class works harder than a previous class?
  - Purpose is to strive for equity and reward hard work, but does establishing a number help?
