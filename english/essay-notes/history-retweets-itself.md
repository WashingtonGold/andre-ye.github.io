Tom Standage
: A graduate from Oxford University, Tom Standage is an English writer and journalist. The following essay, "*History Retweets Itself*", is from his book  *Writing on the Wall: Social Media - The First 2000 Years* (2013).


- Social media can promote freedom and openness because oppressive governments rely on constricting citizens' view of the world.
- **Social media can make repression easier** just the same. (para 1)
  - Social media has been embraced by Hezbollah and other dangerous groups.
  - Chinese users have been censored for criticizing senior officials.
  - The ability to monitor the Internet *may make oppression easier*.
- Social media gives a voice to everyone, even those whose rhetoric is harmful. (para 2)
- Is this complaint valid? (para 3)
  - Technology that makes publishing easier is always admonished for potentially giving the wrong people a voice.
  > [Printers] fill the world with pamphlets and books that are foolish, ignorant, malignant, libelous, mad, impious and subversive; and such is the flood that even things that might have done some good lose all their goodness. -Erasmus on 16th century printing



- Greater freedom of expression means good and bad ideas will emerge alike. (para 5)
  - It also means bad ideas will be challenged more.
  - Surely a world where anyone can publish anything is better than a world where only a few control the publishing.
> "One man's coarsening of discourse is another man's democratization of publishing." [^2]



- People spend a lot of time - perhaps too much - engaging in social networking. (para 6)
  - Nearly half of companies ban workers from using social sites like Twitter or Facbook.
- This was another worry with 17th-century coffeehouses.
  - Denounced as a loss of time and an enemy of productivity.
  - In reality, unexpected connections proved to be catalysts for innovation.
- Some companies conclude that social networking can help.
  - "enterprise social networks" are private social networks.
  - McKinsey & Company: social networking in companies can increase productivity by 25-25%.



- Concern: social media is harming our personal lives. (para 10)
  - The desire to be connected to distant friends goes back a long time. 
  - Objections to, for example, those eager to mail their friends, have also existed for a long time.


- Media has always been used to reinforce social connections.
- The Internet has shown in multiple studies [^3] to bring people closer, while maintaining long-distance relationships.
- Why use technologies of the past that were once decried as detrimental when the current technology will be considered safe after some time?
  - The adoption time buffer for new technologies.


- Social media platforms [^4] are centralized and rely on advertising.
  - All data is stored in one area; thus they have the ability to control users.
  - Must keep both advertisers and users happy.
  - Create a 'walled garden' to boost profit.
- Email and the Web
  - Decentralized
  - Simple to move data
- **Are social platforms a transition?**
  - AOL and CompuServe were centralized services in 1990 but were replaced with the open web.
  - Will social networking move to an open decentralized model?
    - Require open agreements, but safer.
  - Removing advertisers from the loop?
    - Charge users, thus the company is responsible to them and not advertisers


Bottom Line: Social media is not new, and it's not going away. We're more connected, and thus we have more potential for innovative collaboration and to be closer in real life.
