## Introduction
### Mindfulness in Schools
*paragraph 1*
- Mindfulness promises to reduce mental health problems, improve emotional control and concentration.
- Focus on results (raising test scores and easing pressure).
- Claims that mindfulness can help the disadvantaged.

### The Authoritarianism of Mindfulness
*paragraph 2*
- The missionary zeal masks an underlying authoritarianism.
- Victims: fragile, vulnerable, dysfunctional.
- Schools teach children to handle problems by pacifying.
  - Issue is *how* they react, not the conditions that cause them to react.
- Mindfulness could be empowering, but it simply maintains the standard.
- Ambiguity around 'emotional disorders' and 'mental ill health'.

## Mindfulness to the Rescue
*paragraph 6*
- Mindfulness comes from government funding and media attention.
  > the fastest-growing technique in classrooms for teaching self-control. *Washington Post*
- Follows a predictable savior narrative.

### Ignorance of Liberation
*paragraph 10*
- Mindfulness shies away from a 'liberating critical pedagogy' that educates people *out of their oppression.*
- Mindfulness focuses on the individual, not societal problems that may be reflected in the individual.

### Racialization of Mindfulness
*paragraph 13*
- Rhetoric from Mindful School's literature depicts students of color and from poorer communities as lacking agency and power (in need of saving).
- Parallels with Christian missionaries; ingrained in the privledged, whose blindness is how they benefit.
  - White Savior Industrial Complex.

## Cognitive Capitalism
*paragraph 16*
- Mindful school advocates are 'oblivious' to how their programs serve the current social order.
- Mindfulness is shaped by neoliberal ideas.

### The Capitalism in Mindfulness
*paragraph 16*
- Children are being schooled to prepare for roles in the capitalist system.
- Mindfulness helps improve test scores and student behavior, which make managers look good.
- Neoliberal perspective: society doesn't exist - everything comes down to individual choices and responsibilities.
- No providers of mindfulness in schools discuss this problem.
  - Focuses on achievement-oriented passivity.
  - *Indoctrinate* students.

### Discrimination in Mindfulness
*paragraph 19*
- By pathologizing strong feelings, schools instill what is 'correct' behavior.
  - Comes the implication of 'incompetency' or 'illiteracy'.

### Quietism
*paragraph 21*
- What sounds like an engagement with the 'now' is actually quietism.
  - Focus in early years of education is about school readiness; compliance with rules.
- Emphasis on lowering strong emotions like anger sends messages about not speaking up for injustice.
- Mindfulness needs to be combined with action.
