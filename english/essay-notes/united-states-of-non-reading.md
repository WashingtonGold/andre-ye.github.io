<br>

- Not reading has almost become a point of boasting.
  - "clever" and "smart"
  - Students don't buy class books.
  - Reading assigned as recommended, even if labeled as required.
- Assigned reading: **students don't see it as important, faculty does.**
- *Claim of fact:* Student avoidance of reading is not an entirely new *problem.*
  - Begins with individual examples and zooms out on the broader picture.

<br>

- Some course evaluations ask students what percent of reading they did.
  - Ranges from 25% to 90%.
  - Supports argument in that students are not reading enough.
- Kylie Baier and 4 colleagues reported in a *systematic study of college students' reading* (credibility in sourcing):
  - 40% read for exams.
  - 19% don't read for class.
  - 94% of students spend < 2 hours reading for class.
  - 32% believed they could get an A without reading.
  - 89% believed they could get a C without reading.

<br>

- Claim of *value*: an **education crisis.**
  - Students are increasingly reading less asnd less.

<br>

- Acknowledging differing points of view: some departments give guidelines on the number of pages that can be given. 
  - Rebuttal: "struck me as strange" (para 10).
  - Pages of novel and pages of a double-column textbook have different amounts of text and take different kinds of attention and time.
  - Cites Steve Volk (Carnegie Professor of the Year, "so he knows something about teaching), no magic formula for numbers of pages.

<br>

- Further widens scope from college teachers to the American public. (page 11)
  - Justifies this with a 2007 National Endowment for the Arts study that concluded adults' reading habits in severe decline.
  - 57% of adults voluntarily read a book in 2002, down from 61% in 1992.
  - *This is rather old information.*
- To some, this has terrible consequences (educational, economic, social, moral) (para. 13).
  - "Reversing the cup-half-empty conclusion" (para 14), 2013 study showed more than half read books for pleasure.
  - If reading for work & school added to 'voluntary reading', almost all people read 'books' at some point in the year.
- Acknowledges that people are reading (looking at) writing all the time.

<br>

- Biggest issue: not quantity in reading, but a decline in attention.
  - Attention spans, focus, and mindfulness are shrinking.
  - Cites David Carr, 2008.
- "Flipping the classroom" - require reading with a goal.
  - Reading for background ideas is "fading" (para 19).
- Author: "I have stopped worrying constantly about this." (para 20)
  - Everyone is reading.
  - May not sit for hours, may miss a complex argument.

<br>

- Potential critique: going soft. "Don't misunderstand. I worship reading." (para 21)
  - Self-evidence ethos to back the validity of her (perhaps bizzare) opinions.
- Response: writing has evolved **and will evolve.**
  - Cites history.
    - Clay tablets
    - Bronze proclamations of kings
    - Bamboo strips recording rituals
    - Complex philosophical arguments on paper
    - Paintings for royal afterlife
    - Paperback novels
    - Stone tablets proclaiming a moral code
    - Small handheld device
  - Medium is not the message, but medium affects the message.
- **Writing suits our purposes.**
