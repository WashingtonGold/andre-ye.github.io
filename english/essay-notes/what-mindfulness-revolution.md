### Introduction
- **Mindfulness is mainstream.** (para. 1)
  - Endorsed by celebrities, meditation coaches, monks, and neuroscientists.
  > "...founders of this movement have grown evangelical."
- **Definition**: A hybrid of science and meditative discipline.
  - e.g.: eat a raisin very slowly. It's not ridiculous if it requires keys to surviving and succeeding in the modern era.

#### Initial Opinion
- Skeptical. Offering success in an "unjust society" is just helping people cope.
- **Could make things worse.** (para. 3)
  - Instead of encouraging action, tells us our suffering is just within ourselves.
- Mindfulness gurus think paying closer attention to the now will revolutionize the world. **It's magical thinking on steroids.**

#### The Disguise of Mindfulness
- There are some positive components of mindfulness. (para. 4)
  - Can help reduce stress and chronic anxiety.
- The product being sold and the packaging is the problem.
  - Mindfulness is just concentration training.
- Derived from Buddhism, but stripped of teachings and ethics.
- Instead of setting practioners free, it makes them adjust to their problematic conditions.
  - Mindfulness reinforces 'destructive logic'.
  - Something truly revolutionary would attempt to overturn the 'dysfunctional system'.
    > "widening inequality in pursuit of corporate wealth."

### The Capitalism of Mindfulness
- Main idea of mindfulness: our unhappiness is in our heads. (para. 7)
  - When we don't pay attention to what is happening now, we are lost in regrets and fears, which make us unhappy.
- Instead of discussing how attention is monetized by corporations like FTAG[^1], place the crisis in our minds.
  - Don't fight against capitalism, instead are *carriers* of capitalism by arguing that we are the source of all problems.
  > "They tell us solutions that make us contented mindful capitalists." (para. 8)
- Mindfulness tells us not to question and engage critically with causes of suffering in the capitalistic system.
- Selfishness of mindfulness reflects 'capitalist norms'. Embraces capitalism.

| Doctorate in molecular biology @ MIT. | Franchising agent for McDonald brothers. |
| Could adapt Buddhist teachings and practices to help hospital patients deal with stress, anxiety, and pain. | Could grow out his chain into a global empire. |
| Gave stressed Americans 8-week mindfulness courses with certification. | Recruited franchising owners and sent them a training course at 'Hamburger University'. |

(Para 21)

- Top-level corporate executives who take mindfulness:
  - **Do not** examine corporate policies, institutionalized greed, ill will, delusion.
  - **Do** focus on de-stressing, improving productivity.
  - Even if individuals get nicer, mindfulnessis about maximizing profits and keeping the capitalist engine running.

### The Political Naivete of the Mindfulness Revolution
- Revolution happens, mindfulness argues, not through protests or collective sturggles but in heads of individuals. (para. 9)
> It is not the revolution of the desperate or disenfranchised in society, but rather a 'peaceful revolution' being led by white, middle class Ameircans. -Chris Goto-Jones.
- Similar to George W. Bush: 'compassionate conservatism'. (para. 10)
  - Mindfulness becomes a religion in one-self.
  - The public is not one body, but a group of individuals.
- If you are unhappy about being unemployed, look within yourself for solutions.
  - Depoliticizes and privatizes stress.
- **Assumes everyone is free to choose their responses, emotions, and to flourish.**

#### The Selfishness of Mindfulness
- Centered not around the collective, but the individual. (para. 12)
  - Implies selfishness.
  > If this version of mindfulness had a mantra, its adherents would be chanting "I, me and mine."
- Mindfulness is marketed as a vehicle for personal gain: self-optimization is the most alluring.
  - "I want to reduce *my* stress."
  - "I want to enhance *my* concentration."
  - "I want to improve *my* productivity and performance."

#### The Commodification of Mindfulness
- Mindfulness is a $4 billion industry. (para. 14)
  - More than 100,000 books on Amazon have 'mindfulness' in their title.
  - Workshops, courses, magazines, documentaries, apps, bells, beauty products, etc. mindfulness **"paraphernalia"**.
- Mindfulness has "made its way into public schools, Wall Street and Silicon Valley corporations, law firms, and government agencies including the U.S. military."

### False Branding of Mindfulness
#### The False Branding of Mindfulness as Science
- Branding mindfulness as hard science gets public attention. (para. 15)
  - "Neuroscience" and *proving* meditation's benefits.
- Many prominent neuroscientists admit *mindfulness and meditative practice is in its infancy and meditation changes in the brain are trivial*.
> Public enthusiasm is outpacing scientific evidence. -Brown University researcher Willoughby Britton.
- Often, biased researchers who are allegiant to mindfulness may amplify the effect it may actually have.
- **Mindfulness movement has profited off dubious science** and people finding solace in individuality rather than the "hard & real way".

#### The False Branding of Mindfulness as Spiritual
- Marketing hook: connection to Buddhist teachings. (para. 16)
  - Buddhist meditation without Buddhism.
- Insulting and cultural insensitive; a colonial discourse.
- Buddhists have come out against mindfulness.
  > Absent a sharp social critique, Buddhist practices could easily be used to justify and stabilize the status quo, becoming a reinforcement of consumer capitalism. -Bhikku Bodhi (American monk)
- Advertised as being the universal cure to everything. (para. 28)
  - Adapt or perish.

#### The False Branding of Mindfulness as Fulfilling
- McMindfulness: spiritual practices that feel gratifying at first but don't actually change anything.
- Doesn't advocate for anything; simply a capitalistic invention to make money off others' anxiety.
- Mindfulness is not anchored to social good, a moral compass, or ethical commitments.

### The History and Present of Mindfulness as a Control Tactic
- Would the Pentagon invest in mindfulness if mindful soldiers refused to go to war?
- Mindfulness is used to quiet people, not a revolution.
  - Keep them 'mentally fit' to serve their role as a cog in the capitalistic system.
- Privatization of religion in Western societies and faith as science: (para. 24)
  - William James: psychologizing religion.
  - Abraham Maslow: humanistic psychology. 
  - Asian wisdom traditions have been colonized and commodified since the 18th century to produce individualistic spirituality.
    - Accomodates cultural values and requires on substantive change. 
    - Keep the people focused on themselves an dnot the external.

### The Bigger Problem of Mindfulness
- Why pick holes if it appears to be helpful?
- If mindfulness helps people *cope* with toxic conditions that make them stressed, *we need to aim higher.*
  - Why allow 'regimes' to usurp mindfulness for corporate purposes?
  - Why allow auto-exploitation?
- Internalization of focus in mindfulness keeps unequal societal structures internalized.
- Framed as freedom but pays no attention to civil responsibility or *collective mindfulness*.

### The Big Asterisk*
- Mindfulness should not be banned, and those that find it useful are not (necessarily) deluded. (para. 6)
- Reducing suffering is a noble aim and should be encouraged.
- Don't rob mindfulness of its revolutional potential.
