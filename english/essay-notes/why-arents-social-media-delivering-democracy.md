Dana Radcliffe & Essay Context
: Dana Radcliffe has taught business ethics at Cornell University and serves as an adjunt professor at Syracuse University. His writings of ethics in business, politics, and public policy have been featured in the *Huffington Post*. This essay is a version of his remarks presented to the Pacific Council on International Policy on October 10, 2015.

- In the months following the Arab Spring, there were high hopes for social media to act as a carrier of democracy through the world.
- Facebook & Twitter helped spur rebellion against tyrants in Tunisia, Egypt, and Libya.
> "The world is becoming more democratic and reflective of the will of ordinary people." -*Forbes Magazine*.

<br>

- **This optimism is unfounded**. (para. 2)
- Democracies are globally receding.
  - Arab Spring generally did not turn dictatorships into democracies.
  - Democratic governments cannot find solutions to policy questions.
- *Why has social media not made the world more democratic?*

<br>

- **What is the nature of democracy?**
- A self-governing society requires *deliberation*, because there are many competing interests.
  - The goal is 'rationally motivated consensus'.
- The health of democracy is reliant on how much tolerance citizens accept for opposing views and legislation.

<br>

- **Three social media questions on political power**:
  - What power do they confer?
    - Ability to communicate with large number of people.
  - Who possesses the power?
    - When government regulate social media, power is in the government's hands. Otherwise, power is in the hands of the citizens.
  - How do those who have power use it?
    - Protestors organizing demonstrations against govnmts in Arab Spring.
    - Chinese government's censorship.
    - Russian government's propaganda machine.
    - ISIS's recruiting of youths globally.
  
<br>
  
  - Claim: **social media is used as a political weapon.**
  - Political power in social media is usually used in adversarial contexts.
    - Social media is not concerned about deliberation.
      - Users form echo chambers instead of healthy debate, which is required for a democracy.
      - Political information in social media is highly incoherent and opinionated.
      - People are less willing to post political views when they think followers will disagree.
  - Social media works against democratic deliberation; it enforces only our own opinions and decreases our tolerance.

<br>

> In short, with regard to political discussion, current use of social media favors affinity over engagement, expression over debate, silence over disagreement, dogmatism over compromise, and—toward opponents—disdain over respect. This, I believe, is largely why we have so far been unable to move beyond the use of social media as political weapons to make them instruments of deliberative democracy. [^1]
