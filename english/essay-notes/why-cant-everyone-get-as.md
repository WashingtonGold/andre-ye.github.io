## Introduction
*Paragraph 1*
- School reform has been populated by rhetoric framed as top-down mandates of what students should be taught.
- If every student passed the tests, the reaction would not change.

## Disturbing Implications of High Standards
*Paragraph 4*
- "High standards" really means *standards that not all students will be able to meet*.
- If all students met them, standards would be raised high enough such that some students missed them.
- Movement not about "leaving no child behind".
  - Is a sorting device to separate students.
  - Students of color, from low-income families, etc. disproportionately failed.

## Excellence for the Few
*Paragraph 6*
- We are trained to respond with suspicion when a group performs well.
- Excellence is a scarce commodity; success doesn't count unless it is attained by few.
- To ensure this, *evaluate people relative to one another*.
  - Even if everyone has done well, half will always fall below the median.

## Objections to Grade Inflation
*Paragraph 8*
- Claims of 'grade inflation' in higher education.
- Most critics just point to a high number of A's, as if that was a problem.
- The goal is not to do objectively well but to defeat other people.
  - This view: grades should be used to announce who beat who.

## Stop Ranking
*Paragraph 12*
- We need to stop rigging the game such that there will "always be losers".
- Rank objectively, not by comparison.
  - Ranking creates a misleading impression of inevitable and permanent failure for some.
- Artificial scarcity is created by giving out awards.
  - Distinctions manufactured so some cannot get them.
- By framing excellence in this way, competition holds us back from doing our best.
  - Makes productive collaboration less likely.
  - Leads others to focus not on meaningful improvement but in trying to outdo everyone else.
- Encourages **false belief that excellence is zero-sum.**
  - Instead: **everyone may not succeed, but at least in theory everyone could.**
