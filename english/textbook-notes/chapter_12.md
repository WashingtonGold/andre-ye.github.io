# Chapter 5 Notes: "From Revising to Editing"
Andre Ye, 10/30/2020

## Revising Versus Editing
- **Revising:** making changes to a paper to *reflect new thinking or conceptualizing.*
- **Editing:** minor chnages to what the final draft of the paper will be.
  - e.g. correcting misspellings, substituting dashes
- Nicities of style, spelling, and punctuation are not priorities in first and second draft.
  - Develop an argument with evidence.
  - Don't worry about editing early on.

| Revising | Editing |
| --- | --- |
| Writing is a work in progress. | Writing is an almost-finished product. |
| New possibilities in and beyond the text. | Obvious errors and deficiencies. |
| New questions or goals. | Draft, not new avenues of discussion. |
| Purpose and reader's needs. | Grammar, punctuation, spelling, style. |
| Further discovery. | Polishing up essay. |

## The Peer Editing Process
- The composition pyramid:

| Level | Considering |
| Top | Situation, Issues, Thesis, Audience |
| Middle | Organization, use of sources to support thesis |
| Bottom | Style and grammar |

  6. What do you think is working well?
  7. What specific aspect of the essay are you least satisfied with?
  8. What kind of feedback do you especially want?

### Understand the Reader's Responsibilities
- As a reader, **follow along as the early draft is read.**
- Have a conversation about your reactions.
  - Don't jump in and tell the writer what he or she *should* be doing.
- Offer **positive and negative** remarks.
- Template:
  1. Are the questions and issues that motivate the writer clear?
  2. Has the writer effectively described the conersation that published writers are engaged in?
  3. What is at issue?
  4. What is the writer's thesis?
  5. Is the writer addressing the audience's concerns effectively?
  6. What passages of the draft are most effective?
  7. What passages of the draft are least effective?
