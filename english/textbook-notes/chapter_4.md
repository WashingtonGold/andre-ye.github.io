# Chapter 4 Notes: "From Identifying Claims to Analyzing Arguments"
Andre Ye, 10/23/2020

---

## Identifying Types of Claims
### Identifying Claims of Fact
- `Claims of fact` are assertions that *define or classify something into a problem or condition*.
- Claims are more objective (but not pure fact), so are easier to verify.
  - Based on *interpretations* of evidence gathered from different sources.
  - Can also define or classify claims of fact.
- Examples:
  - "It's sunny in Seattle." - a factual claim of fact and easily verified. Also not very interesting.
  - "Heavy regulations on the American automobile industry set Japanese car companies on a track for eventual success." Argues that a problem *has* existed. Difficult to verify, but interesting.
  - "Images of violence in the media create a culture of violence in schools."
- **When reading, continually evaluate evidence to determine if it is enough to persuade you in favor of an assertion.**

### Identifying Claims of Value
- `Claims of value` express an evaluation of a problem or condition.
  - Condition good or bad? Important or unimportant?
- Claim of value can be expressed through value words: *immoral*, *ethical*, etc.
  - Can also be conveyed through tone and attitude.
> Current use of social media favors affinity over engagement, expression over debate, silence over disagreement, dogmatism over compromise, and—toward opponents—disdain over respect. -[Radcliffe](https://andre-ye.github.io/english/essay-notes/why-arents-social-media-delivering-democracy)
- Examples
  - "The increase in homelessness is a deplorable situation that contradicts the whole idea of democracy."
  - "The media are biased, which means we cannot count on newspapers or television news for the truth."
  

### Identifying Claims of Policy
- `Claims of policy` say that a condition *should* exist - a solution to a problem.
  - Oftened signaled by 'should' and 'must'.
- Not all writers make claims of policy explicitly.
- Examples
  - "Taxing the use of fossil fuels will end the energy crisis." Is a policy prescription to solve a problem.
  - "We should reform the welfare system to ensure that people who receive support from the government also work."
