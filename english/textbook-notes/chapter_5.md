# Chapter 5 Notes: "From Identifying Issues to Forming Questions"
Andre Ye, 11/6/2020

---

## Identifying Issues
- How to identify a particular issue.
- Issues do not simply exist in the world in a clean formation.
- Writers must construct issues from situations.

### Draw Upon Personal Experience
- Personal experiences influence how we read, what we pay attention to, and what inferences we draw.
- Use personal experience to argue a point.
  - Don't just tell a story.
  - Strengthen your argument with the story.
- Puts a human touch on your essay.

### Identify What is Open to Dispute
- Think of an issue as a *fundamental tension* between 2 or more conflicting points of view.
- Teach readers about conditions in your own writing.
  - Widens lens of the problem.

### Resist Binary Thinking
- Tease out complexities that may be immediately apparent.
  - Resist either/or fallacy.
- A real issue may combine multiple arguments, or maybe one solution alone cannot fix the issue.

### Build On and Extend the Ideas of Others
- Academic writing challenges but also builds and extends ideas.
- Connect a personal response to a larger one about democracy, fairness, and education.
- Refine the sense of what is at issue, then shape the argument.

### Read to Discover a Writer's Frame
- One can build upon and extend the ideas of others by discovering a **writer's frame.**
  - This is the perspective through which the writer presents the argument.
- Writers that use framing strategies call to attention conversations that set up arguments.
  - Often quoting specific theories or ideas from authors.

### Consider the Constraints of the Situation
- Understand the contexts in which it is raised and debated.
- Consider the *audience*.
  - What are the potential readers involved in the dialogue, and what do they know and need to know?
- What form does the response take?
  - Editorial? Letter?
- Situation can function as a major constraint from ethical standpoint.
