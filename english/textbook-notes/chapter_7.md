Andre Ye, 10/17/2020

## Introduction
- When you visit a source repository, you usually have identified a topic or something you would like to explore.
- Your topic, question, or working thesis will determine the nature and extent of information that is needed.
  - Your search will help refine this scope.
- Confront the complexity of issues and avoid binary thinking.
- A working thesis is just a place to begin.
  - Your interest in a topic or issue may shift.
- Common search tools:
  - Internet search engines.
  - Library catalog.
  - Database.

### Consult Experts Who Can Guide Your Research
- You will want to consult with experts who can help guide your research.

#### Your Writing Instructor
- Your writing instructor can help define the limits of your research.
- Your instructor can help advise whether a topic is too broad or too narrow.

#### Libraries At Your Campus or Local Library
- There is likely no better guide to resources than librarians that work there.
- Librarians can explain the catalog system and reference system.

#### Experts in Other Fields
- Idea for paper originated outside your writing course (e.g. in economics).
- May want to discuss topics with an instructor in that course.

#### Research Manuals, Handbooks, and Dedicated Websites
- Resources exist in abundance for general research and discipline-specific research.
- Helpful in identifying a wide range of authoritative search tools and resources.

### Develop a Working Knowledge of Standard Sources
- Helps to understand what kind of sources are available and what they can help you accomplish.
- Familiarze yourself with types of resources, which should make our converations with experts more productive.
- Types of sources include abstracts, bibliographies, biographies, book reviews, data & statistics, dictionaries or glossaries, encyclopedias, periodicals, and a thesaurus. 

### Distinguish Between Primary and Secondary Sources
- **Primary source:** a firsthand, eyewitness account.
- **Secondary source:** an article, book, or newspaper, e.g. that is a summary of data and conclusions reported in another article.

### Distinguish Between Popular and Scholarly Sources
- Decide whether you should look for *popular* or scholarly books and articles.
- **Popular sources of information** are written for a general audience; these can be specialized but are written such that any educated reader can understand them.
- **Scholarly sources** are written for experts in a particular field.
  - Articles in scholarly journals undergo **peer review** (are not published until they have been careful evaluated).
- Find popular sources to ground your argument, then use scholarly sources to advance your argument.

### Steps to Identifying Sources
1. Consult experts who can guide your research.
2. Develop a working knowledge of standard sources.
3. Distinguish between primary and secondary sources.
4. Distinguish between popular and scholarly sources.

## Searching for Sources
- Once you have decided which sources you want to use (primary or secondary, popular of scholarly), you can take steps to locate that information.
- May begin a tour of the university or local library.

### Perform a Keyword Search
- A keyword is a topic; it defines the topic of your search.
- A search by subject is helpful if you begin your research while you are formualting your thesis.

### Try Browsing
- Browse is a headings search.
  - You an browse displays of alphabetic lists of entries, show the number of records for each entry, and indicate whether there are cross-references for each entry.
  
## Evaluating Library Sources
- The information we encounter will vary widely in its relevance and overall quality.
- Information will vary in its relevance.
- **Skimming** involves four steps.
  1. Examine the table of contents and index.
  2. Read the introductory sections.
  3. Skim for the argument by reading topic sentences.
  4. Check notes and bibliographic references.

### Examine the Table of Contents and Index
- Analyzing the table of contents can help reveal which topics the author focuses on, which may be valuable in your own research.
The index is a recurring alphabetical list of the important and recurring concepts in a book.

### Read the Introductory Sections
- Many authors use a preface or an introduction to explain themes they focus on in the book.
- **Abstracts** serve the same purpose, but are usually only 250 words long.

### Skim for the Argument
- Reading the first sentence of each paragraph can help determine the relevance of a book or an article. 
- Types of phrases and questions can help you get a sense of what the author is trying to accomplish and whether the author's work will be of use to you.
- If the source still seems promising, you can reflect on whether it will help you answer your research question.

### Check the Notes and Bibliographic References
- Look closely at writers' notes and bibliographies to discern who they feel are the important voices int he field.

### Assess Accuracy and Credibility
- Find the following information for each article or book:
  - Author's background and credentials
  - Author's purpose
  - Audience
  - Nature of the conversation
  - How the author supports the argument
  - The accuracy of the author's evidnece
  - The author's biases and personal views.

### Steps to Evaluating Library Sources
1. Examine the table of contents and index. Consider the most relevant chapters and headings to your topic and the list of relevant subjects.
2. Read the introductory sections. Get an overview of the author’s argument.
3. Skim for the argument. Read topic sentences to determine the source’s relevance to your research. Go deeper to assess the type and quality of evidence the author uses. Note whether the author uses credible evidence to support the argument.
4. eck the notes and bibliographic references. Identify other writers an author refers to and the titles of both books and articles. (Are the names and titles cited in many other works?)
5. ess the information for accuracy and credibility. Find out about the author’s educational background and relevance to the topic, issue, or question that the author addresses. Consider the types of evidence the author uses, the source of data, and whether the data can be verified.
