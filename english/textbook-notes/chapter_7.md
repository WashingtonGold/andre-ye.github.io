- Your topic, question, or working thesis will determine the nature and extent of information that is needed.
  - Your search will help refine this scope.
- Confront the complexity of issues and avoid binary thinking.
- A working thesis is just a place to begin.
  - Your interest in a topic or issue may shift.
- Common search tools:
  - Internet search engines.
  - Library catalog.
  - Database.

- Librarians can explain the catalog system and reference system.

#### Experts in Other Fields

- May want to discuss topics with an instructor in that course.

#### Research Manuals, Handbooks, and Dedicated Websites
- Resources exist in abundance for general research and discipline-specific research.
- Helpful in identifying a wide range of authoritative search tools and resources.

### Develop a Working Knowledge of Standard Sources
- Helps to understand what kind of sources are available and what they can help you accomplish.
