# Course Mechanics Week 4
- Mistakes in essays all are tied back to the active reading process.
- Essay, reading response, analysis feedback

## Essay Grading
  - **A**: nuanced or sophisticated claim.
    - Passed argument threshold.
    - Has something that shows creative or unique thinking; reflects complexity.
  - **B**: most of the four criteria of augmentation.
    - Makes a strong attempt at an argument.
  - **C**: a summary or descriptive essay.
    - Simply telling other people's arguments.
    - Perhaps descriptive instead of argumentative.
  - **D**: factual errors or other significant problems.
    - Interpretive errors, getting basic pieces wrong.
  - **F**: does not meet requirements of assignment.
    - Plagiarised, other mistakes.

## Common Struggles Across Essays
- Summary of other texts in main argument or in subclaims without explanation.
  - Don't summarize Diamond as the main argument; it's not your argument, it's Diamond's argument.
  - Don't just summarize for a subclaim; explain and connect it to your claim.
- Struggles with complex texts.
  - Misinterpretation: Locke and use of Christian justifications.
    - Not necessarily making a Christian justification for private property; instead moving a bit away from it.
  - Pay attention to this, especially if you decide to base your text off simplistic readings.
- Specificity (may be the hardest item)
  - It's not enough to say "ideology caused conquest".
    - Which ideology? How?
  - Tell us the mechanics.

## Reading Responses and Active Reading
- The better you get with reading responses, the better you will be able to make claims for essays.
- Active Reading Practice: *Asking questions of the text*.
  - What is their question?
  - Evidence or claim?
  - Where am I? The structure of the essay - is this the introduction, an evidence section, ...?
- **From big to close reading**
  1. After reading for argument, do a 'close reading'.
  2. Find a specific passage, phrase, or word that elicits a "WTF Moment".
    - e.g. "state of nature", "the commons", "use", "my property" in John Locke
  3. Start to ask "why questions".
    - Why 'my property' in reference to others?
    - Why is commons of 'no use'?
    - Why is consent from others not necessary?
    - What is a state of nature and why is it used?
  4. Speculate answers.
    - Power: relationship between employment, labor, and ownership.
    - Conquest: lack of consent would justify conquest.
    - Language: use, efficiency, productivity are embedded values.
    - Assumptions: state of nature and 'property in personhood' are rhetorical idealizations.
