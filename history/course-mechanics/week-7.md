# Course Mechanics Week 7
- Next essay (essay 2) will be peer-reviewed.
- Looking for improved argumentation.
- Papers were quality work and thinking deeply about content.
  - However, would not call any of them argumentative decisively.
  - Develop strong and independent thinking that can justify claims through appropriate use of evidence and **analysis.**
- Active reading and argumentative reading relationship.

## Active Reading
- Struggling with a text?
  1. Ask questions - what don't I understand?
  2. Experiment - try just the topic sentences.
  3. Ask for help - in discussion or with Dr. Reagan.
- This class looks at a wide variety of articles.
  - Articles are often written by scholars for scholars.
  - Historical documents written in code.
  - Popular articles and experiences.
- Looking at texts to extract meaning to support or challenge ideas.
- **Keep the struggle.**
  - Ask specific questions about what you don't know.
- Experiment with your reading practice.
  - Skim, look for keywords, just read topic sentences.
  - Even if you have a method working well enough, try another method, perhaps to become more efficient.

## Reading Response and Analysis
- The chain of identifying moments of confusion:
  1. WTF moments.
  2. Genuine question.
  3. Focus on confusion rather than certainty.
- Don't look for the answers and the pieces that fit in easily. It won't tell us anything new.
  - Will confirm our own beliefs and what a text is telling us.
  - Not generating new inquiry or discovery.
  - Academia is about pushing the boundaries of what we know about ourselves to push new insights.
- Find new insights by focusing on the moments where we are confused and things do not make sense.
- Highlight these moments:
  - Explanation is weird.
  - Language is odd.
  - That part was interesting or changed my thought.
- Learning to focus on those parts.

### Complete Reading Response Process and Advice
1. Analysis is a question *and* an answer.
2. Answer your WTF moments.
3. Keep the questions tied to the text and time period.
4. Use a quote to ground you in the text.
5. Speculate.
- Speculation in analysis should not *take you away* from the history and content.
- Don't speculate about something tangential. 
- Common move: "we see nativism in the 19th century, this reminds me about right now."
  - A comparison half-analysis, but it's not the type of textual analysis that needs to be developed.
- If one moves in this process, they will be able to develop an analysis.
- Stay as closely grounded to the text as one possibly can
  - Perhaps frame a quote.
  - Find what jumped out to *you* that made you reconsider.

### Example From WTF Moment to Analysis
```
At the time the Lowell cotton mills were started the caste of the factory girlw as the lowest among the employments of women. In England and in France, particularly, great injustice had been done to her real character. She was represented as subjected to influences that must destroy her purity and self-respect. In the eyes of her overseer she was but a brute, a slave, to be beaten, pinched and and pusehd about. It was to overcome this prejudice that such high wages had been ofered to women that they might be induced to become mill-girls, in spite of the opprobrium that still clung to this degrading occupation.
```
- WTF moments.
  - The `lowest` occupation?
  - How does Robinson know what is happening in England and in France?
  - Conflicting high wages and shame.
  - Why would the overseers be beating, pinching, and pushing when it seems economically disadvantageous?
  - The use of slave.
    - Implies pressure.
  - Use of 'caste' implies a hierarchy. Where does Robinson place the 'factory girl' on this hierarchy? What does she determine to be a 'noble role' for women? This contradicts with previous discussion on the independence and joy of having work.
  - What is used by 'purity'?
