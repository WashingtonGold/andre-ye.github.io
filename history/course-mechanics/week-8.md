# Course Mechanics Week 8
- In this lesson: active reading, reading responses, they say / I say
- Much of the class is centered around agumentation and identifying other people's arguments. 
- The more comfortable we get with this idea, the better we can argue.

## Four Stages of Critical Analysis
1. I observed
2. I asked (a conceptual question)
3. I speculated
4. I proved
- The building blocks of *analysis*, not *argumentation*.
  - Makes a claim; gestures towards argumentation but not quite an argument.

## Academic Argumentation
- You can have a brilliant argumentative idea, but it's not quite an argument until it's framed correctly.
  - Your argument has 'stakes' (importance), significance, a relation to broader claims.
  
### Talking Over
- Wrong practice: happens not only in student and academic papers, but also in regular conversation.
- Come up with an idea, share it, and no one picks up anything?
  - Can happen a lot in a class with students a lot.
- Same things happen in academic texts.
  - If you produce an argument that says the same thing as another author - *why are you doing it?*
  - Say it because you weren't listening or you were ignoring.
- **Do not just reiterate the claims of some author.**

### Entering a Conversation
- They Say / I Say: academic writing is like entering a conversation.
- Academic moves: although *x* says *y*, we need to consider *z*.
  - The move between the *they say* and the *I say*.
- It is about *entering the conversation.*
  - What is *new* that you're bringing to the conversation?
  - Do not just say the same thing; bring a new idea and a new interpretation.

## Argument Identification
- Active reading, reading for structure, reverse engineer (what is their question?)
- Frame your argument in light of other arguments; you need to have the 'they say' component.

### Reverse Engineer and Argument
- Try to discover what their *central question* is.
- What is the question that guides the entire work they are trying to identify?
  - e.g. Diamond: Arguing against European superiority and racism.
- Go back to the question of what is guiding the study and what authors are writing against.

### Frame Your Argument Against Another Writer
- Frame your intervention around that author's claim.

## Complete Process
1. Identify the main question from a text.
2. Identify the main argument from a text.
3. Frame your argument as a response to others.
