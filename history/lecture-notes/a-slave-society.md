### Comments
- This set of lectures will focus on slavery in the 'modern era' (19th century).
- To understand the impact, one needs to think about *the economics*.
- Why does slavery become so entrenched in American society?
  - "Slave society" - virtually every aspect of the society (political, social, cultural, economic systems) touched by or designed by slavery.
- America in the 19th century was a slave society.
  - Hardly much not touched by the institution of slavery in the 1830s, 40s, 50s.
- **Why was it, and how did that come to be?**
  - What was the system of slavery?
- Move from thinking about *colonial slavery* to *modern slavery* (modern in "modern world", post-Enlightenment).
  - Institution lasted into the capitalistic period.
- An idea that slavery was slow, unproductive, unprofitable, etc; therefore it *had to die.*
  - Slavery withered and died because it could not compete with industrialization.
  - Is this theory true? Why did it last so long?
  - Relationship of capitalism to slavery.
- Was slavery antithetical to the rise of capitalism?
- **Was the United States a slave society?**
