# Empire & Revolution: Society and Politics in Colonial America
Andre Ye, 10/20/20 & 10/22/20

## Introduction
- 1783: *The Death of Major Peirson* by John Singleton Copley.
- Battle of Jersey on the island of Jersey on the channel between England and France.
  - A significant battle in the American revolution that involved no Americans.

## Central Questions
- Central Questions:
  - What caused the American Revolution?
  - What role did ideology, economics, class, empire, and race play in shaping the dynamics of the revolution?
    - Was it primarily material or ideological?
    - What type of revolution was it?
- Anti-colonial war: empire and self-determination
  - **War of independence** from colonial domination, a **civil war** between the various forces within American society, a **world war** fought both in American and in Europe.
    - A *global* anti-colonial moment.
- Civil war: revolution fractured by class, race, gender, indigeneity
  - Role of African Americans, the poor, indigenious peoples, women, and colonial elites.
- Social or political revolution?
  - The unequal political, social, economic, and ideological structure of American society remained intact after the Revolutionary War.
  - The Constitution incorporated and reflected many of these tensions.
- Relationships between indigenious and black slaves?
  - Maroonage: comes from wrecked ships and people who stake out encampments, in context of slavery - slaves would escape plantations and have nowhere to go, establish encampments.
  - Sometimes would combine with indigenious communities.
  - Seminole in Florida; adopted large numbers of escaped African slaves.
  - Mourning Wars - indigenious peoples would go to war with other nations to incorporate more people.

## Chain of De-Colonization and Destabilization
- Nations were not able to maintain heavy control over empires in the Americas.
  - French Empire collapses 1754-63
  - English Empire follows 1775-83
  - Spanish and Portuguese 1810-1825
- After strong anti-empire sentiment, colonization in the Americas largely collapses.
- Revolutions
  - 7 Years War
  - Hatian Revolution (1790)
    - Slave-led revolution, undoes political power of the French and social institution of slavery.
  - American Revolution
  - Anti-colonial revolutions in the Spanish colonies that create a series of independent countries.
- The Revolutionary War was not as unique as many theorists and historians would like to think.
- Spreads worldwide conceptions of rights.

## French and Indian War / Seven Years War - 1754-1763
- Americans: started war, Washington led a military incursion into indigenious regions allied with France
  - Sieze and speculate it
- Spiralled into a global war.
  - European War was about 7 years.
- Land and tax troubles
- 1763 proclamation
- The **French are defeated, and the English win**.
  - A phyrric victory; the English spend a vast amount of money.
  - French drop their claims; this was only partial regardless.
- England was 'overstretched' and wanted ot prevent ongoing conflict with indigenious peoples in the interior
- Launched George Washington's military career.

## Proclamation line of 1763
- Established a line that forbids English settlement beyond that line and guarantees land to indigenious peoples in the interior.
- Established by the English government unilaterally, part of peace negotiations.
- George Washington went over this line and launched the Seven Years global conflict; need to limit and restrict settlement.
  - Self-imposed, in a sense.
- The English are in debt and cannot make the colonies pay for them. Limit costs by restricting settlement.

## Political Outlook on Independence
| Date | Colonial Population |
| --- | --- |
| 1700 | 250,000 |
| 1775 | > 2,000,000 |

- 2 million people: a series of different types of people with different political interests that did not all align with Independence
- Not unilateral support for Independence. 
  - Different imperial interests.
  - Natives & indigenious peoples have their own interests
  - Slaves
  - The colonial gentry
  - Smallholders & the poorer class
  - English governmental officials
  - Women

## Colonial Possibilities - Land and Labor
- For colonial elites, there were a few ways to get rich
  - Plantation system
  - Mercantilism & trade
  - Both based on access to agricultural production, need land and labor.
- Need lots of people and lots of land to run a product.
- Middle colonies are producing wheats and other agricultural goods, Carolinas are producing rice & dyes, the economy is more diversified, but needed land and labor.

## Colonial Mercantilism
- Merchants not directly tied to the land; people who would provide capital or resources for international trade or had the network to make sales possible.
- People who were largely **in port cities in the North** (Boston and NY), but also Charleston (South).
- Relied on access to capital and networks of information.
  - Could finance the building of a ship.
  - Finance insurance.
- Distinct; more urban and more worldly.
  - Different from the plantation elite, but tied to producing goods that can get into international trade.
  - Also interested in maintaining slavery and access to land.

## Slavery and the Colonial Elite
- Your wealth derived from the slave system.
- Slave states were **by far the richest states**.
  - Richest people were slsave owners.

## Slave Population & the Stono River Rebellion
- Slaves want to be free - fundamental premise.
- Slaves in the South and the North.
  - Sojourner Truth, for example, enslaved in the North.
- Willing to fight for their freedom in a series of rebellions.
- In a sense, Bacons' Rebellion was a slave revolt.
- **Stono Rebellion of 1739**.
  - First explicit slave rebellion in the colonies.
  - Terrified the white population.
  - Slave ship brings in several dozen _newly kidnapped_ African slaves.
  - About 60 who revolt as they are being 'broken'.
    - Break a slave by getting them adjusted to what it means to be a slave.
  - Collectively revolt and kill 23 white people, burn an entire plantation down. Create a banner and write "liberty", use to march and attempt to get to the county seat.
  - Later overtaken by the Carolinan militia; killed and executed.
- **Aftermath**
  - Banning importation of slaves directly from Africa for 10 years.
  - Idea: *newly enslaved slaves were the most dangerous*.
- Sometimes, in collective/political unity for 'liberty'.

## Indigenious Peoples, Middle Ground, & Pontiac's Rebellion
- The French were defeated and lost; the indigenious allies did not give up.
- Once the French stopped fighting, the indigenious kept on fighting.
- Did not want to see English settlement continue to encroach on their territory.
- **Pontiac's Rebellion**.
  - Very understudied yet significant in indigenious history.
  - An alliance of almost all peoples in the interior on the western side of the Appalachias uniting against European settlement into the interior.
    - Whole sets of peoples agree in a political alliance to go with war against English settlement.
  - Initial uprising is very successful
    - Sieze 8 forts from English control, including Fort Detroit, as well as other significant forts
    - Forces the British, who had just established the Proclamation Line, to send *more military resources into that area*.
  - Message: don't trifle with the indigenious peoples.
- Fighting to protect their own sets of interests.

## Rural Revolt
- Rural peoples; poor whites who were also in revolt.
- 1760s and 1770s, main problem: debt.
- Farming relies very heavily on credit.
  - Spend the entire year working and producing, getting the land ready, harvesting.
  - Sell everything that you have and get all your money at once.
  - Over the course of the whole year, need credit; money to get food, supply, to get through to that point.
- Debt and credit is an important part of modern farming.
- Highly reliant on debt; markets fails and crops fail.
- **Saddled with debt from the year and no way to pay it off**.
  - Hope the next year is better, but it very well won't, and you have agglomerated more debt.
- **Courthouses will come after you**. Slaves, lifestock, property can be siezed.
  - Debt became an increasing problem for the rural poor.
- Northern speculators came to places like NH and Vermont and attempted to buy up farming land and sell it at higher prices.
  - Further indebted farmers.
- **Revolt**
  - Breaking jails
  - Rioting out judges passing sentences based on debt
  - Attacking tax collectors who could put them further into debt
- Colonial peoples had a limited degree of self-governance.
  - Could have its own legislature
  - Did not have representation in the mother country (England)
  - Had no Parliamentary representation.
  - The Crown could revoke the charter for self-governance and amend/veto sets of laws.
    - A degree, but limited degree, of governance.
  - Colonial courts largely being governed by locals.

## Urban Poverty in the Colonies
- The Urban Crucible - Gary B Nash
  - Northern cities - conflicts between urban poor and symbols of the British government or control.
- Boston Massacre, 1770.
  - Thought of as a prelude to the revolution. 
  - Colonial subjects attacking British tax collectors
  - Raiding homes of court justices and throwing material into the street and lighting them on fire.
  - British send more troops to stop the disorder.
    - Seen as tyranny.
  - Soldiers open fire in return, killed 3 people
- Rioting over the **Townshend Acts**
  - A sales tax on things everyone needs - tea, paper, etc.
  - Fairly onerous; urban poor people needed to pay significantly higher for those items.
