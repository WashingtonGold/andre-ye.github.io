# Gender & Industrial Capitalism: Wages, Domesticity, and Forms of Labor
Andre Ye, 10/27/20 & 10/29/20

## Introduction
- First industrialized workforce in the US was all women.
- Textile manufacturing was done exclusively by women.
  - Universally true **to this day**.
- Women and Their Work in the Metropolis, Stanley Fox, *Harper's Bazaar*, 1868
  - Illustration: industrial work as a natural extension of the domestic sphere?
  - Depicting several illustrations of women in manufactures revolving around an image of a woman looking after her child (domestic sphere)
  - These professions were **not safe** and 'womanly', as portrayed.
      - e.g. Toy Painters. fumes from paint.
 
 ## Key Questions and Points
 - **Central Questions:** Why were the first industral workers primarily women? What ways to systems of gender and the economy, patriarchy and capitalism, relate to one another?
 - Industrial capitalism
  - Combination of market capitalism with new source of productive power.
    - Creation of wage labor.
    - Transformation of the environment with significant consequences.
    - *Wage slavery?*
- Gender Theory: Gender Constructions and their Class Character
  - The "Cult of Domesticity" - Working Women too?
    - Women's cheapness?

## Household Economy and Social Parity
- In order to understand changes of industrial revolution, (epoch-defining moment) look at *what came before.*
- Pre-industrial revolution: **the household was the economic unit.**
  - Not just a place of rest.
  - A place of economic activity *for both men and women.*
  - True in agrarian production (house as the extension of a farm and field).
    - Women to perform ancillary work to allow agrarian work to pass.
    - Gender division of labor within economic units.
      - Men and women would have different sets of tasks.
      - True almost universally.
        - Indigenous societies - women did the planting and harvesting.
    - Men and women found work in the household.
  - The household became a unit of **economic power**.
    - Women performed tasks like: repair tools, make satchels for harvesting, make food, 'reproductive work'

### Artisanal Labor
- Household as the individual unit - tied to home production.
- Artisanal production: *complete manufacture of some thing.*
  - From end to end, artisans can completely craft something.
  - Often hand-made.
  - Artisan must know every stage of creation.
- Cooper, shipwright, smiths, etc.
  - Performing every stage of production to create, e.g., barrel.
  - Going **from zero to finished product.**
- Artisan apprentices.
- **Controls the entire work process.**
  - Control speed.
- Sell *what they made.*

### Agrarian Power
- Source of power is human (or animal) muscle power.
  - Body power *empowers the process.*
- The extent to which production is possible is the extent to which human bodies can produce something.

## Market Revolution and Social Transformation
- Transformations happening *slowly*.
  - Pre-industrial; advent of the 'market revolution' and capitalism.
- **Market Revolution of the 18th century.**
  - People were drawn into commercial relationships of exchange based on currency and tender.
    - Debt, credit, market relationships.
  - 17th century, people in a yoeman household probably produced everything by themselves.
    - Need as sweater, make a sweater.
  - 18th century, people are drawn into networks of commercial exchange.
    - Specialize in a particular skill of expertise.
    - You can sell yourself and get access to a money market economy.

### The Transportation Revolution
- Constructing canals. Waterways main network of exchange (pre-industrial railroad).
- Water way access becomes key trading area.
- Advent of Eerie Canal in early 19th century.
  - Connects Hudson River; opens up the entire continent into Chicago and the great plains.
  - Isolated farmers can get their products into major hubs within a few weeks.
  - **Not industrial steam power.**
    - Barges pulled by horses.
    - Still relied on physical labor.
- Regardless, the network allowed people to buy and seel goods that they had never before.

## Division of Labor
- The type of work women were doing in the household could be much more lucrative.
- They could sell their labor to other markets
- Women who were doing weaving or textile making could spend more time doing that (assembling goods) and get money to **buy other things they might need.**
  - Otherwise would need to make on their own.
- Work in the household *being monetized.*
- Over time, **collectivize and aggregate isolated points of labor.**
  - Develop a process in which economies of scale could be produced.
  
### Putting Out System
- Even if not being aggregated in the same place, it can be *socially aggregated.*
- Women could do work in their home, *put out* their work.
  - Collected, paid women, and assembled to sell.

## Industrial Revolution
- **Epoch-defining transformation in human history.**
- Combination of capitalist production relationships and industrial power sources.
- **Externalizing source of productive power from limitations of the human body.**
  - The human body can only produce *so much.*
- Rapid growth in *machinery* powered by nonhuman sources.
- Driving industrial capitalism:
  - Shift in the energy regime and social organization underlying society.

## Industrial Power
### Water
- Driving the industrial production and expansion: water.
  - Anything that can burn (wood, forests, coal, oil). Before this: water.
- Being located near water helped.
- Water that had a 'drop' (using gravity to drive motion).
- New England: factories were located around **water sources*.
  - Very first textile mill in the United States (Slater Mill in Massachusetts) outside of Boston.
  - In order to make the mill work, channel water underneath the factory to drive a turbine connected to machinery.
  - Dammed the river to control the flow.

### Textile Production
- **Cotton textiles were the number one manufactured product.**
- Water can be linked to drive the 'power loom'.
- Transforming hand loom; externalizing driving forces of loom to water.
- Looms are connected by belts to turbines, all driven **in uniform**.
- Emphasis on efficiency of production.
- Every floor could specialize.
  - First floor - spin into thread.
  - Second floor - thread into textiles.
  - Third floor - died and packages, etc.
- Driven by **central power source.**

## Dramatic Environmental Impacts
- Need to be located at sites where *there is potential for power.*
- Lowell, 1845
  - Within a few decade, transformed into an industrial city.
    - Based on the new method of manufacturing and textile production.
  - Water enabled textile production.
  - River is lined with factory.
    - When waterfront fills up, build canals.
  - Water could serve as acess to markets.
- Controlling the flow of the water was a major problem for early industrialists.

### Pollution on the Concord River
- 1921. Dyes could be put in the river.
- Industrial pollutants.
- One of the first signs that industrial production and technology would have significant environmental impacts.

### The Merrimack River Watershed
- **Transforms the law.**
  - The path of rivers changed
  - Property rights altered to support industrialism.
- Unintended consequences.
- Lowell *was* a farming community.
- If, as an industrialist, you dam the river and the resulting flow is a trickle?
- Lawsuits - farmers would sue industrialists.
  - River flows through property, infringing on property rights.
  - Sued but court did not side with them.
    - Farmer-farmer relationship: not acceptable.
    - Industrialist-farmer damming relationship: acceptable.
      - Industrialists bribing, corruption?
      - Emminent domain
    - Partially on **Lockean grounds.**
      - The most industrious and efficient use of space.
      - Lockean principles of property.
  
### Waltham Bostom Manufacturing Company Mill
- Very large manufactures being constructed very quickly.
- Primary interest in generating as much profit as possible.
- Builders are cutting corners - leads to the first series of industrial accidents.

### Industrial Accidents
- Largest accident in US history up to then - 1860 collapse of Hemberton Mill
  - Lawrence, Massachusetts
- Factory collapsed, 145 deaths of factory workers.
  - 100-something injured.
- Within a few decades, it has been completed translated.

## Social Impacts on Industrialization: Labor
- People's relationship **to their labor.**
  - How is labor used?
  - Social relationships.
- Gender  - the shift of power: externalizing from physical bodies to turbine power sources that could drive machinery.
  - Metaphorical as well - changing the relationship of power to which people have with their own bodies.
  - You are no longer working and your own pace and control.

### Cheap Labor and Women
- Industrial labor - you are working to the pace of the machine.
  - Adapt your physical standards to that of industrial production.
- Widespread **labor discipline**.
  - A factory that is all operating at the same time.
  - Throughput production contingent on each part of the process being accomplished at the same time.
  - *Everyone needs to be present and working at the same pace.*
    - A few people who are late: can be a catastrophe for the production process.
    - Need a regime of labor discipline to make systems work.
- **If you need so many people, why are women being employed?**
  - Women's labor was cheap.
    - *Cheaper*.
  - *Why* was women's labor cheaper?
    - Industrial process - *removes the limitations of physical bodies from production.*
    - Perhaps gendered division worked agrarian production, but how does it make sense in production?
- **Answer**:
  - Labor supply
  - Expectations
  - Oppurtunities elsewhere
  - Not the main moneymakers of the family.
- *What does it mean to say that women's labor is cheaper?*

## Cult of Domesticity
- Cultural standards going into evaluating what labor is worth.
- A man or a woman is doing the same amount of labor.
  - can we say that it's about production? No.
- A series of factors go into influencing what women's labor was worth.

### Standards on Social Participation
- Development of cult of domesticity.
- Separate sphere standard, 'cult of true womanhood'
- Idea that *women's only or natural social role is tied to family, home,a dn domestic considerations.*
  - Anything with public involvement (work), politics, intellectual pursuits, etc. seen as outside of her 'natural sphere'.
- Severe restrictions and limitations on what women's acceptable social role was.

## Women and Labor Markets
- Women's access to labor markets in the early 19th century was highly restricted.
  - Domestic servant (maid, cleaner, cook), as a nurse (medical aid), or a teacher.
  - Limited options.
  - Professional: property, business, politics, law: closed to women. 
  - Women did not have full and equal access to the full scope of labor markets.

### Industrial Labor
- Impacted access to labor market.
- Overabundance and supply in availability for this type of work.
  - There weren't very many options.
- In a labor market, when you have a huge labor abundance, the price of labor goes down.
- _A confluence of cultural expectations & cultural standards that influence economic variables._
- 'Cheapness' is being constructed along ideological constructions *and* the advent of markets being applied to humans.
  - Labor being sold in sets of markets.
  - People's cultural ideas are influencing this.

### Social Impacts of Industrialization: Wages
- What does it mean, then, to be a factory girl?
- Example: Time Table.
  - 1868 Time Table of the Lowell Mills
  - Arranged to make the working time 60 hours per week.
  - The standard time will be marked at noon, by the bell of the Merrimack Manufacturing Company.
  - Locking the gates.
  - 12 hour workday. 
  - Compelled to certain time restrictions.
- People were selling wages (a new mechanism)
  - People are selling their labor for a certain amount of time.
  - Not selling a barrel or some artisanship craft, you are selling yourself and your time.

### Beauties of Our Factory System - Otherwise, Lowell Slavery
```
Let oppression shrug her shoulders,
And a haughty tyrant frown,
And little upstart Ignorance,
In mockery look down,
Yet I value not the feeble threats
Of Tories in disguise,
While the flag of Independence
O'er our noble nation flies.

Oh! isn't it a pity, such pretty girl as I
Should be sent to the factory to pine away and die?
Oh! I cannot be a slave, I will not be a slave,
For I'm so fond of liberty,
That I cannot be a slave.
```
- Comparison of status as a worker in the factories to **slavery**.
  - Writing this at a time when *chattel slavery actually existed.*
  
## Productivity and Labor Discipline
- It's not outside of the realm of reasonableness to make the comparison.

### The Lords of the Loom and the Lords of the Lash
- Being sold and gathered in labor regimes
- Comparisons between slaveholders and overseers.
- Foremen looking over your work, you were not independent in how you were doing your work.

### The Liberator
```Our wealthy citizens, as a body, are hostile to the interests fo the laboring classes? Is it not found int heir commercial enterprise, which whiten the ocean with canvas, and give employment to a useful and numerous class of men; it is not found in their manufacturing which multiply labor and cheapen necessities... It is a miserable characteristic of human nature to look with an envious eye upon those whoa re more fortunate in their pursuits, or more exalted in their station."
```
- Abolitionists debated this.
  - If you're talking about abolition, include the wage system.
- Debates in the pages of the abolitionist press: should we include the waged system as part of the system of slavery, or not?
