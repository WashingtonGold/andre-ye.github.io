# Gender & Industrial Capitalism: Wages, Domesticity, and Forms of Labor
Andre Ye, 10/27/20 & 10/29/20

## Introduction
- First industrialized workforce in the US was all women.
- Textile manufacturing was done exclusively by women.
  - Universally true **to this day**.
- Women and Their Work in the Metropolis, Stanley Fox, *Harper's Bazaar*, 1868
  - Illustration: industrial work as a natural extension of the domestic sphere?
  - Depicting several illustrations of women in manufactures revolving around an image of a woman looking after her child (domestic sphere)
  - These professions were **not safe** and 'womanly', as portrayed.
      - e.g. Toy Painters. fumes from paint.
 
 ## Key Questions and Points
 - **Central Questions:** Why were the first industral workers primarily women? What ways to systems of gender and the economy, patriarchy and capitalism, relate to one another?
 - Industrial capitalism
  - Combination of market capitalism with new source of productive power.
    - Creation of wage labor.
    - Transformation of the environment with significant consequences.
    - *Wage slavery?*
- Gender Theory: Gender Constructions and their Class Character
  - The "Cult of Domesticity" - Working Women too?
    - Women's cheapness?

## Household Economy and Social Parity
- In order to understand changes of industrial revolution, (epoch-defining moment) look at *what came before.*
- Pre-industrial revolution: **the household was the economic unit.**
  - Not just a place of rest.
  - A place of economic activity *for both men and women.*
  - True in agrarian production (house as the extension of a farm and field).
    - Women to perform ancillary work to allow agrarian work to pass.
    - Gender division of labor within economic units.
      - Men and women would have different sets of tasks.
      - True almost universally.
        - Indigenous societies - women did the planting and harvesting.
    - Men and women found work in the household.
  - The household became a unit of **economic power**.
    - Women performed tasks like: repair tools, make satchels for harvesting, make food, 'reproductive work'

### Artisanal Labor
- Household as the individual unit - tied to home production.
- Artisanal production: *complete manufacture of some thing.*
  - From end to end, artisans can completely craft something.
  - Often hand-made.
  - Artisan must know every stage of creation.
- Cooper, shipwright, smiths, etc.
  - Performing every stage of production to create, e.g., barrel.
  - Going **from zero to finished product.**
- Artisan apprentices.
- **Controls the entire work process.**
  - Control speed.
- Sell *what they made.*

### Agrarian Power
- Source of power is human (or animal) muscle power.
  - Body power *empowers the process.*
- The extent to which production is possible is the extent to which human bodies can produce something.

## Market Revolution and Social Transformation
- Transformations happening *slowly*.
  - Pre-industrial; advent of the 'market revolution' and capitalism.
- **Market Revolution of the 18th century.**
  - People were drawn into commercial relationships of exchange based on currency and tender.
    - Debt, credit, market relationships.
  - 17th century, people in a yoeman household probably produced everything by themselves.
    - Need as sweater, make a sweater.
  - 18th century, people are drawn into networks of commercial exchange.
    - Specialize in a particular skill of expertise.
    - You can sell yourself and get access to a money market economy.

### The Transportation Revolution
- Constructing canals. Waterways main network of exchange (pre-industrial railroad).
- Water way access becomes key trading area.
- Advent of Eerie Canal in early 19th century.
  - Connects Hudson River; opens up the entire continent into Chicago and the great plains.
  - Isolated farmers can get their products into major hubs within a few weeks.
  - **Not industrial steam power.**
    - Barges pulled by horses.
    - Still relied on physical labor.
- Regardless, the network allowed people to buy and seel goods that they had never before.

## Division of Labor
- The type of work women were doing in the household could be much more lucrative.
- They could sell their labor to other markets
- Women who were doing weaving or textile making could spend more time doing that (assembling goods) and get money to **buy other things they might need.**
  - Otherwise would need to make on their own.
- Work in the household *being monetized.*
- Over time, **collectivize and aggregate isolated points of labor.**
  - Develop a process in which economies of scale could be produced.
  
### Putting Out System
- Even if not being aggregated in the same place, it can be *socially aggregated.*
- Women could do work in their home, *put out* their work.
  - Collected, paid women, and assembled to sell.

## Industrial Revolution
- **Epoch-defining transformation in human history.**
- Combination of capitalist production relationships and industrial power sources.
- **Externalizing source of productive power from limitations of the human body.**
  - The human body can only produce *so much.*
- Rapid growth in *machinery* powered by nonhuman sources.
- Driving industrial capitalism:
  - Shift in the energy regime and social organization underlying society.

## Industrial Power
### Water
- Driving the industrial production and expansion: water.
  - Anything that can burn (wood, forests, coal, oil). Before this: water.
- Being located near water helped.
- Water that had a 'drop' (using gravity to drive motion).
- New England: factories were located around **water sources*.
  - Very first textile mill in the United States (Slater Mill in Massachusetts) outside of Boston.
  - In order to make the mill work, channel water underneath the factory to drive a turbine connected to machinery.
  - Dammed the river to control the flow.

### Textile Production
- Water can be linked to drive the 'power loom'.
- Transforming hand loom; externalizing driving forces of loom to water.
- Looms are connected by belts to turbines, all driven **in uniform**.
- Emphasis on efficiency of production.
- Every floor could specialize.
  - First floor - spin into thread.
  - Second floor - thread into textiles.
  - Third floor - died and packages, etc.
- Driven by **central power source.**

## Dramatic Environmental Impacts
- Need to be located at sites where *there is potential for power.*
- Lowell, 1845
  - Within a few decade, transformed into an industrial city.
    - Based on the new method of manufacturing and textile production.
  - Water enabled textile production.
  - River is lined with factory.
    - When waterfront fills up, build canals.
  - Water could serve as acess to markets.
- Controlling the flow of the water was a major problem for early industrialists.

### Pollution on the Concord River
- 1921. Dyes could be put in the river.
- Industrial pollutants.
- One of the first signs that industrial production and technology would have significant environmental impacts.

### The Merrimack River Watershed
- Unintended consequences.
- Lowell *was* a farming community.
- If, as an industrialist, you dam the river and the resulting flow is a trickle?
- Lawsuits - farmers would sue industrialists.
  - River flows through property, infringing on property rights.
  - Sued but court did not side with them.
    - Farmer-farmer relationship: not acceptable.
    - Industrialist-farmer damming relationship: acceptable.
      - Industrialists bribing, corruption?
      - Emminent domain
    - Partially on **Lockean grounds.**
      - The most industrious and efficient use of space.
      - Lockean principles of property.
  
  **Will continue on 10/29.**
