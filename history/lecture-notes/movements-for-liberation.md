# Movements for Liberation: Abolition and Expansions of Freedom
Andre Ye, 11/19/20

## Introduction
- Framework for thinking about what those in a political position to struggle against slavery were up against.
  - Who had the interest to undo the slave system?
  - Most people adopted some form of the argument - "It's natural", "been with society", "doesn't impact me", etc.
- Am I Not a Man and a Brother? British Anti-Slavery Society, 1785.
  - Depicts a slave pleading or praying, chained to himself, caption "Am I Not a Man and a Brother?"
  - Physical body - appears as if there are lash wounds; a person who is in torment and in pain.
  - It is significant that he is on his knees.
  - Who is the actor to free the slaves? - free white people of the North.
  - Question of agency and the relationship of power - could slaves themselves? ideas of self-emancipation. Use of language between man and brother: positioned for someone to take off the chains.
  - What is the claim for freedom and liberty?
  - A claim of equality; does not say human but says man.
  - Appeal and claim to masculinity.

## Central Claims
Movements for Liberation: Slaves, Women, and Workers
- Central Questions:
  - What did liberation mean to different segments of American society?
  - How did enslaved peoples, women, and workers veiw freedom? Why?
  - How does ideology operate in society? How do ideas spread and what impact do they have?
  - What agency do the dispossessed have? When is violence justified?
- Abolition and feminism in the 19th century
  - Abolition and slave agency
  - Abolition and women
- The Women's movement
  - Abolitionist women
  - Working women
  - Seneca Falls
- Workers' Liberation
  - Debated with the abolitionist movement
- Class and Disjuncture
  - Civil War and Emancipation
  - Black Agency in the war
  - The Negro's Hour
- Key ideas:
  - Looking at the workers' and women's movement.
  - Thinking about how these different pushes begin to form a political crisis that ultimately resolves in the Civil War.

## America as a Slave Society
- Slavery is not just a part but a definitional foundation touching practically everything in American society.
- Difficult to get over the relationship of slavery with the economy; culture, status, politics, etc. tied to the institution of slavery.

### Life Under Slavery
- Depictions coming from slavemasters were inaccurate; looking at the economics we see that violence is rooted inside the system.
  - The "Happy Slave" is difficult to rectify and justify with other pictures.
  - This level of violence is not even given the capricious nature of white supremacy and racism.
  - There is a lot of rage, anger, and anti-black hostilities.
  - Immediate economic justifications: violence could be inflicted at any moment.
- Things that are obstensibly not violent, but *are*: e.g. the sale of a child.
  - A whole hierarchy of violence worked into the system.
  - Slave system is being undone; Northenors are becoming from involved into what slavery looks like.

### Maintaining Order and Slave Culture
- Based on the capricious system.
- Movements for liberation and some autonomy.
- Degrees of independence and power; also power coming from enslaved peoples.
  - Slavery was a totalizing system, but did not mean that *every hour* was pure terror.
  - There was some negotiation.
- Around things that cannot be legislated or controlled: the development of *culture*.
  - Cultural practices, values, and systems of belief cannot be legislated and regulated.
  - It is difficult, if not impossible, to do so.
  - Slave autonomy - established a space of control for themselves.
- An entire series of interesting and *syncretic* belief systems.
  - Syncretic rituals; melding original ideas with new ideas.
  - Americas: the banjo is a syncratic tradition by taking west African gourd instruments (like a squash gourd) and adapting it to the western tin drum.
    - Merges the European snare drums and African strings in a new use.
  - Mixing religious beliefs, wedding practice.
    - Demonstrates a wedding tradition - stick used to dance with comes from a West African tradition of celebrating a new life together by jumping over a branch.
    - Americas - became jumping over a broom, entering a new phase, etc.
    - Example of a syncretic tradition.
    - Blending of types of instruments.
- Used as a powerful site for resistance and teaching lessons.
  - Lessons of brier rabbit and fox fables.
    - Tradition of cunning, not wishing the worst.
    - Anger and hatred gets both in trouble.
  - Stories of slave practice are just part of the culture and autonomous development of culture.
  - Culture of resistance, survival, intelligence.
    - Values intellect and cunning, not letting emotions get the better of you.

### Threat of Sale
- Degree of power and agency.
- Sale is unidirectional; the agency and intellect.
  - Feigned illness, etc. to get themselves *returned*; a degree of slave agency.
- A violent and totalizing system, but there was a degree of influence in those circumstances.

### Slave Religion
- Enslaved persons cultural practice; slave religion.
- Like slavemasters that emphasized the Curse of Ham, were told the story of Exodus.
  - Moses leads to the enslaved Jews to the promised lands.
- Slaves are highlighting different aspect of Christian practice.
  - Hard not to see those practices as forms of resistance; political and social connotations.
- Image: enslaved person preaching to a congregation, but the master and his family are there as well.

#### Gospel of Freedom
- Emphasizes the liberatory and humane practices not only in Exodus but in Jesus' teachings in the New Testament.
- Testaments to human freedomand Emancipation.
- Foundations of Christ's teachings around the poor and the righteous to be rectified.
- A resonant idea in Christianity; part of the reason why it spread to quickly in the Roman underclass and the slave tradition.
  - Perhaps as support, but resistance present.

## Slavery and Abolition: Slave Resistance
- Embedded in the culture; in actual actions. Not only beliefs and talkings.
- People resisted the slave system, sometimes a day-to-day resistance that could be acts of sabatoge.
  - e.g. acts of hoeing a field; given the tools to do that, wouldn't you break the hoes.
  - Stealing food to help someone who was sick.
  - Dissembling or feigning ignorance, sets of day-to-day resistance that were worked into the system.
  - Arguments of laziness part of what is coming into play.
- Overt actions: running away became increasingly violent. 
  - A major part of resistance mainly done by men.
  - Few women ran away. (Why was this?)
  - Individual acts of resistance.
- Collective acts of resistance.
  - Form a work group and refuse to do work.
  - Form rebellions; use the tools and turn them as weapons in an attempt to liberate oneself.
    - A whole series of rebellions in the 19th century that ran apace decade-by-decade.
    - SOme form of large scale revolt starting in 1800 with Gabriel's rebellion, 1811 in the New Orleans Uprising, etc.

### Large Scale Slave Rebellions
- Significant slave uprisings in the systems.
+ Major themes: slave agency, *who has the power and interest to end the institution of slavery?*
+ Depiction: asking to be liberated by others, is not taking action on their own behalf to make that liberation possible.
+ Truth, Jabobs, etc. are at the center of their activity that generates broader movements in the mid nineteenth century.
+ Really began to have a destabilizing and conflictual role in American society, lead to the civil war.
+ Modern slavery intensified under markets and profitability
+ Focusing not on the system but slave culture.
+ Multiple forms of resistance; syncratic traditions, resistance to social death.
+ In the stories that people told each other.
+ Not overt restistance, cunning, critique of anger.
+ Seen in slave resistance, with curse of ham; used to justify slavery vs the old testament stories of exodus, or the new testament gospels of Christ teachings of ultimate justice and redemption.
+ Idea of a greater justice outside of human justice and systems that ultimately will be rewarded by God and will lead to the ultimate jubilee, liberation.
+ Either in the life afterwards or a new religious figure bringing redemption on Earth.
+ Thinking about this as resistance.
+ Overt forms of resistance; day-to-day and individualized practices of slave resistance.
+ Shirking work; not being told what to do.
+ Sabatoging/lying/feigning ignorance.
+ Seen in ledger books; (Morgan’s argument – slave resistance read as laziness)
+ Overt: running away, an increasing crisis in American society of the 1840s.
+ Thousands of people were running away at significant damage to slave owners (collateral of access to loans, etc.).
+ A significant cost.
+ Slaves running away are becoming an increasing political problem nationally.
+ Trying to assert their form of autonomy; an individual form of resistance.
+ Steal away to get yourself out of the situation; more riskily as a group (easier to track, only as fast as the slowest numbers, etc.)

+ Collective acts of overt resistance:
+ Individual forms of resistance, but also collective forms of resistance in which groups of slaves would take action against their master.
+ Outright rebellion or revolt; every decade in the 19th century there was a large scale slave revolt that threatened and intimidated the slavemasters that were constantly in the fear of slave resolt.
+ True in majority-black counties (places where the black enslaved population was the majority), but also in places like Virginia and every salve state.
+ 1800 revolt: Gabriel’s Rebellion.
+ Gabriel was a literate salve.

- Solution: get rid of the source of the prejudice out of their respectability.
- An example of justifications for slavery witht he paternalist ethos.
- Henry clay -leading american politicians and aboliitonist.
- Paternalist ethos - it's in your best interest to be ensalved, etc. you cannot be civilized, so alvery will help you .

- Faced consequences; were he usbjects of public riducple and riotes.

### Slavery and Moral Suasion
- Moral suasion; you need to eventually convince enough people that this system is wrong, that we need to do something else.
- That we shoudls lowly end the system and can have a slow proess of abolition.
- Anyone born after this date will be free, some payout system, etc.
- Morallly wrong, need to conincce nouehg people and need a gradual process of ending it...................................

```
I a aaware that many object tot he severity of my language, but is there not cuase for severity?
I will be as harsh as truth, and as uncompromising as jusitce. oN this subject, i do not wish to think, or to speak, or write, with moderation.
NO! NO!
Tell a manw hose house is on fire to give a mdoerate alarm
tell hm to moderatelyr esuce his wife from the hands of the ravisher
tel  the mother to graduallye xtricate her babe from the fire into which it has fallen
but urge me not to use moderation in a c uase like the present.
i am in earnest - I will not equivocate - I wil not excuse - I will not repeate a single inch - and i will be heard.
```
- the apathy of the people is enought o make everys tatue leap from its pedestal and to hasten the resurrection of the dead.0

- Very few white people; the liberator numbers were very small.

### American Anti Slavery Society
- Abolitionist sentiments were not widespread or widely held.
- Nevertheless are militantly committed to the righteousness of their cause and of taking action.
- Begin to found organizations that advocate for moving for anti-slavery in a series of ways.
- organization slie the ameircan anti-slavery society founded in 1839 working politically and legislatively, attempting to get petititons sent to the government. 
  - Thinking about a timeline, fazing out, partial emission, etc.
  - All kinds of attempts to funciton in a more direct, political, ideological, and moral way.
- Slave accounts were often published by press as part of political propaganda to indicate the evils of slavery.
- Methods are being developed during this time to push the envelope.

### Abolition, Citizenship, and Freedom
- A new kind of ideological conception of freedom, claims to rights, synthesis of ideas that we have seen, etc.
- Perhaps there are moral claims outside of legal standards for what is righteous and good.
- Maybe if we are not thinking strictly religiously, we can think of it being inherent to mankind.
  - Perhaps call them "sets of rights" *inherent* to **humanness**.
  - Everyone should have access to and should not be denied.
- An emerging univeralistic conception of liberty; one that is not tied to any sets of limitations like reason, etc.
  - You can say that one of the bases is the new intellectual tradition and new sets of writings, ideas, and histories.
    - Declaration of Independence (document that had been forgotten in the American legal tradition; not a legal document or a foundational legal piece, was written at the height of the Revolutionary War as a political statement).
    - A formerly enslaved black man - David Walker - uncovered the document as part of claims for immediate revolution.
    - *All men* have rights; a synthetic tradition being chrystallized to create new antiracist traditions.
- Walker is rediscovering tradition of putting new interpretation and synthesis of these ideas around universalistic claims of rights, drawing on the past.

### Abolition and Race
- Needed to be around questions of race; pro-slavery arguments like moral, Christian, civilizational, based on rights, etc. boils down to enslaved peoples are inferior.
- Abolitionists fought against the idea that enslaved peoples were inferior.
- Pro-colonization claims (are inferior but perhaps slavery should end) begin to be undone in the 1830s to 1840s.
  - Proof: oratories, traditions, intellectual ideas, legislative documents, etc.
  - Attempting to articulate this set of ideas.
  - Producing new claims about race; coming to argue against racial inferiority and to challenge pseudoscience notions of phrenology, etc.

### Militant Abolitionism
- David Walker: wrote an appeal, political tract that re-introduced the Declaration of Independence and a more universalistic tradition of rights beyond specifying rights.
- After publication, was mysteriously killed/died for reasons historians are not entirely sure about.
  - Perhaps in retaliation for his political work.
- What emerges: type of militant abolitionism that is uncompromising, highly moral and self-conscientious, and for **full claims** of equality.
  - Not half-baked and gradualist like early intellecutal contributions.
  
### Direct Action and the Underground Railroad
- Led to direct action and work; Tubmanw as a leading figure in the underground railroad.
- John Brown participated in Underground Railroad operations.
- In Canada, he tried to stage an army to go back into the US to liberate more salves that led to the Harpers Ferry raid.

#### Harpers Ferry and John Brown
- Was in discussion with Frederick Douglass.
- Brown tried to encourage Douglass to participate; Douglass didn't know that it would work (but supported it in its righteousness).
- How to end this system entrenched in American society, politics, and economics could be ended with a few dozen?
- Brown's raid indicates the escalating militancy of abolitionism.
  - Small, but were not waiting around for gradualist change.
  - Had been involved in decades' worth of political work and not seeing much movement.

### Retaliation
- Physical violence, threats.
- Boston: William Llyod Garrison is almost lynched.
  - Marched into the commons with a noose around his neck becuase he was so unpopular *in the North*.
  - Leading liberal city in the North
- Antislavery building is burned to the ground by angry mobs.
- Civil wars; white residents against black residents in New York.
  - Agains the cause of joining civilization.
- Printing presses attacked. 
- Abolitionists faced tremendous hostility and outright violence.

### Northern States
- Abolitionists/Northernors are not necessarily the same.
- Did not want to do much about it; many thought it was right.

#### Mail Ban
- Thinking about this politically; Congress refused tot ake any action.
- laws would prevent abolitionists from sending newspapers in the mail *that was guaranteed*.
- ANyone could get their newspaper published in one state r colony and have it distributed anywhere for the free exchange of ideas. 
- Conress moves to ban the distribution fo abolitionist ideas in the mail system.
- Could be siezed and destroyed.

#### Gag Rule
- Ban the discussion of slavery on the Congress floor.
- Any persons or citizen can petition their government of redress; Congress must address it.
- 1840s; Congress refused to do so, banned the introduction of any abolitionist petitions, readings, and ideas from being read on the floor.
- Clear Constitutional violations. 

### Abolitionist Women
- What does this allow you to do? -Cannot vote, cannot run fooor office, cannot petition the government, acannot riwrite about it, speaking oturs are met with angry mobs disrupting your ability to speechh, burning down buildings,a ttacking the press, etc.
- Abolitionist women are encountering hostility from Americna society for even speaking on the issue.
- "Am I not a woman and a sister?" (1830s after the British Anti-slavery Society Medallion).
- Adapting the abolitionist movement from male-centric standard to women's emancipation and equality on those terms.
- Women and men both deserving of rights.
- Universal human claims to autonomy, independence, freedom, and soforth.
- Overwhelming majority of people who ran away did not becomie movement activists.
  - Try to get a job in the North and not be involved in the level of engagement as political activists.
  - Could integrate into Northern society - still segregated - but could get work as laborers, as homeworkers, as domestic servants, etc.
- **Industrialization happening at a similar time to this.**
- Grimke sisters began to lecture; congregationalists and clergy wrote a public letter against women.
  - The thing that gives women power is defference, moral standing, etc.
  - Erodes standing in society.
- Angelina Grimke writes about the status of slaves to the status of slaves and of women.
  - Began to challenge these notions as well.
  - Changing mentality, consciousness of what conditions of slavery mean.

### London 1840 Anti Slavery Convention
- Worldwide antislavery convention held in London.
- England banned slavery in 1833.
  - Undid the colonial slave system; remaining large practioner of slavery is the United States.
  - Host a convention in which many leading antislavery activists were expected to speak.
  - (Brazil continued to practice slavery past the United States, had a horrendous slave system; Portguese slavery.)
  - First resolution past disallows women to serve as delegates or to speak at the floor.
  - Women that spent weeks on a boat to have the experience were not allowed to participate.
  - Foundational moment; basis for the emergence of the womnen's question.

### Seneca Falls
- Founded by activists; Elizabeth Cady Stanton in 1840 comes back to the US; in 1848, has organized a women's rights convention in New York.
- Looking at slavery; looking at women's role in society.
- Drafted: requesting property ownership, divorce, and the right to vote.
  - A contested thing.
  - Frederick Douglass was part of this convention; encouraged the right to vote.
- Is ridiculed and faced many hostility.
- Many women took their name *off* the Declaration.
- Nontheless became a foundation for a parallel movement of women's rights in tandem.

### What is Liberation?
- How do we define terms of what liberation is and what it means to be free?
- A number of different segments of American society from enslaved peoples themselves.
- Women - middle-class, abolitionist reformers, enslaved women, Northern manufacturing workers - all generating claims around liberation.
- Forms of liberation that looked different for each segment of American society yet were nontheless collectively pushing political and intellectual boundaries.

#### Forms of Resistance
- In the face of this power and oppression; what is justified?
  - Ignoring effectiveness. What is reasonable?
  - What role does violence play in this?
  - Is it righteous? Is it effective?
  - Questions women of the women's rights movement and formerly enslaved peoples were facing.
- Brown: it is time to rise up and revolt. Douglass: I'm not sure; maybe it's right, but will it work?
- Who has the social power to address these wrongs?
  - Who can make this happen, and by what means?
  - Challenging questions that abolitionists and free peoples struggled with during these decades.
