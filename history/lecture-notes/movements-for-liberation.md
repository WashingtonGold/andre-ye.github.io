# Movements for Liberation: Abolition and Expansions of Freedom
Andre Ye, 11/19/20

## Introduction
- Framework for thinking about what those in a political position to struggle against slavery were up against.
  - Who had the interest to undo the slave system?
  - Most people adopted some form of the argument - "It's natural", "been with society", "doesn't impact me", etc.
- Am I Not a Man and a Brother? British Anti-Slavery Society, 1785.
  - Depicts a slave pleading or praying, chained to himself, caption "Am I Not a Man and a Brother?"
  - Physical body - appears as if there are lash wounds; a person who is in torment and in pain.
  - It is significant that he is on his knees.
  - Who is the actor to free the slaves? - free white people of the North.
  - Question of agency and the relationship of power - could slaves themselves? ideas of self-emancipation. Use of language between man and brother: positioned for someone to take off the chains.
  - What is the claim for freedom and liberty?
  - A claim of equality; does not say human but says man.
  - Appeal and claim to masculinity.

## Central Claims
Movements for Liberation: Slaves, Women, and Workers
- Central Questions:
  - What did liberation mean to different segments of American society?
  - How did enslaved peoples, women, and workers veiw freedom? Why?
  - How does ideology operate in society? How do ideas spread and what impact do they have?
  - What agency do the dispossessed have? When is violence justified?
- Abolition and feminism in the 19th century
  - Abolition and slave agency
  - Abolition and women
- The Women's movement

  - Working women
  - Seneca Falls
- Workers' Liberation
  - Debated with the abolitionist movement
- Class and Disjuncture
  - Civil War and Emancipation
  - Black Agency in the war
  - The Negro's Hour
- Key ideas:
  - Looking at the workers' and women's movement.
  - Thinking about how these different pushes begin to form a political crisis that ultimately resolves in the Civil War.

## America as a Slave Society
- Slavery is not just a part but a definitional foundation touching practically everything in American society.
- Difficult to get over the relationship of slavery with the economy; culture, status, politics, etc. tied to the institution of slavery.

### Life Under Slavery
- Depictions coming from slavemasters were inaccurate; looking at the economics we see that violence is rooted inside the system.
  - The "Happy Slave" is difficult to rectify and justify with other pictures.
  - This level of violence is not even given the capricious nature of white supremacy and racism.
  - There is a lot of rage, anger, and anti-black hostilities.
  - Immediate economic justifications: violence could be inflicted at any moment.
- Things that are obstensibly not violent, but *are*: e.g. the sale of a child.
  - A whole hierarchy of violence worked into the system.
  - Slave system is being undone; Northenors are becoming from involved into what slavery looks like.

### Maintaining Order and Slave Culture
- Based on the capricious system.
- Movements for liberation and some autonomy.
- Degrees of independence and power; also power coming from enslaved peoples.
  - Slavery was a totalizing system, but did not mean that *every hour* was pure terror.
  - There was some negotiation.
- Around things that cannot be legislated or controlled: the development of *culture*.
  - Cultural practices, values, and systems of belief cannot be legislated and regulated.
  - It is difficult, if not impossible, to do so.
  - Slave autonomy - established a space of control for themselves.
- An entire series of interesting and *syncretic* belief systems.
  - Syncretic rituals; melding original ideas with new ideas.
  - Americas: the banjo is a syncratic tradition by taking west African gourd instruments (like a squash gourd) and adapting it to the western tin drum.
    - Merges the European snare drums and African strings in a new use.
  - Mixing religious beliefs, wedding practice.
    - Demonstrates a wedding tradition - stick used to dance with comes from a West African tradition of celebrating a new life together by jumping over a branch.
    - Americas - became jumping over a broom, entering a new phase, etc.
    - Example of a syncretic tradition.
    - Blending of types of instruments.
- Used as a powerful site for resistance and teaching lessons.
  - Lessons of brier rabbit and fox fables.
    - Tradition of cunning, not wishing the worst.
    - Anger and hatred gets both in trouble.
  - Stories of slave practice are just part of the culture and autonomous development of culture.
  - Culture of resistance, survival, intelligence.
    - Values intellect and cunning, not letting emotions get the better of you.

### Threat of Sale
- Degree of power and agency.
- Sale is unidirectional; the agency and intellect.
  - Feigned illness, etc. to get themselves *returned*; a degree of slave agency.
- A violent and totalizing system, but there was a degree of influence in those circumstances.

### Slave Religion
- Enslaved persons cultural practice; slave religion.
- Like slavemasters that emphasized the Curse of Ham, were told the story of Exodus.
  - Moses leads to the enslaved Jews to the promised lands.
- Slaves are highlighting different aspect of Christian practice.
  - Hard not to see those practices as forms of resistance; political and social connotations.
- Image: enslaved person preaching to a congregation, but the master and his family are there as well.

#### Gospel of Freedom
- Emphasizes the liberatory and humane practices not only in Exodus but in Jesus' teachings in the New Testament.
- Testaments to human freedomand Emancipation.
- Foundations of Christ's teachings around the poor and the righteous to be rectified.
- A resonant idea in Christianity; part of the reason why it spread to quickly in the Roman underclass and the slave tradition.
  - Perhaps as support, but resistance present.

## Slavery and Abolition: Slave Resistance
- Embedded in the culture; in actual actions. Not only beliefs and talkings.
- People resisted the slave system, sometimes a day-to-day resistance that could be acts of sabatoge.
  - e.g. acts of hoeing a field; given the tools to do that, wouldn't you break the hoes.
  - Stealing food to help someone who was sick.
  - Dissembling or feigning ignorance, sets of day-to-day resistance that were worked into the system.
  - Arguments of laziness part of what is coming into play.
- Overt actions: running away became increasingly violent. 
  - A major part of resistance mainly done by men.
  - Few women ran away. (Why was this?)
  - Individual acts of resistance.
- Collective acts of resistance.
  - Form a work group and refuse to do work.
  - Form rebellions; use the tools and turn them as weapons in an attempt to liberate oneself.
    - A whole series of rebellions in the 19th century that ran apace decade-by-decade.
    - SOme form of large scale revolt starting in 1800 with Gabriel's rebellion, 1811 in the New Orleans Uprising, etc.

### Large Scale Slave Rebellions
- Significant slave uprisings in the systems.
