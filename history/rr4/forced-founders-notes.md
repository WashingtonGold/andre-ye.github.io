## Notes on Section 1: Introduction [^1]

### Main Ideas
- Nonelites powerfully influenced Revolutionary politics.
  - Virginian gentlemen's struggle to extend freedom were aided by other freedom struggles.
  - The gentry that made the declaration of independence were very interested in the actions of natives, slaves, and smallholders.
- The image of confident colonial elite pushing for freedom is lacking and excludes other groups.

### Opening Ideas
- Americans like to imagine the colonial elite - Thomas Jefferson & George Washington, to name two - as proud and optimistic leaders; instead, their desperation drove them to the American Revolution.
- Consider **Jacob Hite**, who in April 1774 took desperate measures like: (p2)
  - Crashing down the gates of prisons
  - Placing weapons in the hands of slaves
  - Was one of the wealthiest men in Berkely County, Virginia

### Example: Jacob Hite

- Hite was the son of a successful land speculator.
- 1760s scheme to gain land from Cherokee Indians
  - Business partner (Richard Pearis) had a half-Cherokee son (George)
  - George asked Cherokees for 150,000-acre land
  - Sold the land to Richard Pearis and Jacob Hite
- Failure of deal
  - British officials feared it may provoke Cherokees to join an anti-British confederation; South Carolina court voided the deal.
  - Left Hite in debt, had property to be auctioned to pay it off.
  - Fall 1773 - price of tobacco sunk to lowest levels ever.
  - Sheriff siezed Hite's slaves and horses to jail (Apr. 12, 1774)
- Reclamation of property
  - Thomas Hite (son) and his gang surrounded the jail and siezed the salves & horses
  - The slaves would suffer if Sherriff recaptured them [^2]; Hite used this to convince and arm slaves against the Sherrif.
- **Debt was a powerful reason to protest Parliament.**
  - Sherriff feared jury would side with Hite:
  > "...it being too general a wish among the people to evade the payment of their Debts and render the authority of [court] Judgements... of none effect."[^3]
  - Virginia courts refused to try suits brought by creditors [^4] against debtors [^5]
    - Temporarily closed to protest Parliament's assault on "American liberty" and to prevent creditors from taking property and freedom from debtors.
    
<br>

### Hite's story as proof against a faulty historical record
- Surely Hite's story of desperation must not apply to other American figures; Patrick Henry, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson.
- Opposition historical viewpoint:
  - Washington and Jefferson were confident and successful, continuing westward expansion was inevitable given:
    - Slave ownership
    - A solid relationship with British merchants
    - Exercising "almost unchallenged hegemony" over other classes in the province
  - The key to Virginia gentlemen's secure position was a good relationship with small farmers, then
    - Surrounded by farmers, tenants, artisans, sailors
    - Historians question the assertion of gentry [^6] confidence
- It was not that the gentry [^6] 'pulled the strings' of other groups [^7]; each group had leverage but, in complex and perhaps unintentional ways, helped push the gentry towards rebellion. (pg. 4)

### Definitions
What defines the 'gentry'?
- Owned money, slaves, and land.
- Sat on the House of Burgesses, Executive Council, benches of county courts.
- Fought for capital, labor, and land in each group
  - British merchants over capital
  - Agricultural workers over labor
  - Natives over their land
  

*merchant*
: mercantile firms and transatlantic slave traders in Glasgow, London, and other British ports.
*storekeepers* or *factors*
: employees of merchants located in the Chesapeake.
*traders*
: independent Virginia entrepreneurs.

### Ways gentry-group interactions shapes independence
- British-gentry-slave relationships
  - Enslaved population grew from 9% to 40% by 1775 [^8]; good news for slaveowners and allowed House of Burgesses to stop importation of slaves [^9].
  - British merchants persuaded Britain's executive body to veto Virginian taxes on every imported African slave.
  - Threat of new slaves + financial damage by London government = support for political independence.
- Late 1774, enslaved Virginians, who hoped to become free, furthered patriotic centiment and aided white Virginians.
- Nonexportation provisions of Continental association deprived smallholders of their export income.
  - Contributed to gentry's decision to make formal declaration of independence.
