## Context/Background
- Written by James Madison, addressed to Thomas Jefferson
- Addressed as "Dear Sir New York Ocr. 17. 1788", Written from New York City.
- Comparison of the function performed by a bill of rights in republican and monarchical systems of government.
- The text contains certain encrypted words that have been decrypted; these were written in a numerical code Madison and Jefferson used for confidentiality.
- Excerpt begins at "*The states which have adopted...*" and ends at "*...will be unnecessarily sacrificed to the many*".

## Notes
- At this time, the States are adopting the new Constitution and are putting it into action "next March".
- Alterations have been proposed for the new Constitution.
  - They are controversial.
  - Opinion groups:
    - Some wanted for *further guards of public liberty and individual rights*.
    - Some believed such an addition was not necessary (i.e. it already existed).
    - Some believed such articles were not to be in the Constitution at all.
- **James Madison's Opinion** on the Bill of Rights
  - > My [*James Madison*] own opinion has been in favor of a bill of rights; provided it be so framed as not to imply powers not meant to be included in the enumeration. At the same time I have never thought the ommission a material defect, nor been anxious to supply it even by subsequent amendment, for any other reason than that it is anxiously desired by others.
  - Paraphrasing: James Madison is in favor of a bill of rights given that it does not list too many individual powers; he is also fine with its exclusion (not a 'material defect'). The reason why he supports it is largely because others are so 'anxious' to include it.
  - Believed the Bill of Rights could be of use and "of no disservice" if executed properly.
- Issues with the Bill of Rights that James Madison points out:
  - xyz

**Work in progress**.
