## Navigate

## Introduction
- November afternoon in 1821: land that was going to become Lowell, Massachusetts.
  - Merrimack & Concord Rivers, Pawtucket falls.
- Two Boston industrialists: **Nathan Appleton** and **Patrick Tracy Jackson**, selecting site for next textile factory.
  - Reshape the countryside, create a city.
- Lowell was *the showcase industrial city of the North*.
  - "City of spindles".
  - Women flooded into the city to take advantage of:
    - High wages and moral paternalism[^1] of corporations.
- Lowell became an industrial powerhouse.

### Broader Themes Across New England's Social Fabric
- Lowell was the footprint of the industrial revolution in the United States.
- This revolution also shaped the social fabric of New England.
- Rise of industrial capitalism:
  - Joined wage labor employment.
  - Disrupted traditional gender roles.
  - Accelerated class stratification[^2].
- **Women** negotiated changes - they were the first industrial labor force.
  - Reliance of textile corporations on female labor based on traditional gender devision of labor in textile work.
    - Employed women for the first time outside the home.

- Social horizons were broadened, cultural restraints on mobility strengthened.

### The Fight for Independence and Social Respect
- Working women of Lowell fought to create independent and socially respected role. (page 2)
- 'Factory girls' fought against gender oppression and labor exploitation.
- Women's secondary social status prevented them from acheiving economic and political rights.
  - Unable to vote.
  - Would face ostracism if they spoke.
- Levied radical critiques of the factory system.
  - Wage labor as 'wage slavery'.
  - Utilized strikes and worker organization.

### The Historical Contradiction
- Historians put feminist and labor movements in 1800-1860.
- Rarely do texts engage with class *and* feminist methods. (page 3)
- Writings about Lowell and feminism:
  - Confine scope to middle-class suffragettes.
  - Ignore rise of industrialism.
    - Stigmatizes working women.
  - Apply narrow class focus.
    - Labor focus is usually at home.
- Reagan: class and labor plays a part in feminism.
  - Marxists tried to place female workers into the workingmen movement. (page 4)
- **New trend of scholarship:** emphasizes important overlap between Marxist and feminist thought.
  > "This essay is an attempt to move in that direction." (page 4)

## Labor and the Cult of Domesticity
- Begins at page 5.
- In colonial and revolutionary eras, a woman's social status was tied to her labor.
  - Families were the unit of economic production.
  - Gender division facilitated production and accomodated farm life.
    - Men labored on staples of family income (crops),women managed and supplied the household.
  - Women's work was vital to the survival of the home.

- Gender division required mutual dependency. (page 5)
  - Trust: *kept women in respectable positions.*
- Respectability did not change second-class citizenship.
  - Independence was restrained under aspects of society.
  - Women could not:
    - Make contracts
    - Sue in cort
    - Own property
    - Make a will
    - Serve on juries
    - Vote or run for office
- Legal restrictions *have economic implications.* (page 6)
  - Married woman's wages, income, and estate are property of her husband.

### The Evolution of the Role of Women into the Public Sphere
- Women's evolution into the public sphere: industrial capitalism. (page 6)
- Commercial market expansion & proto-industrial production changed men's and women's relationships with home and work.
- More economical to purchase mass-produced cloth than to make it at home.
- **Freed up women's labor.** (page 7)

"putting out system"
: local merchant-artisans organized distribution of unfinished goods to be worked on at homes and returned to markets for sales.

- "Putting out systems" were at low piece-rate wages but gave women income to contribute.
  - A common practice. (page 7)
- Weaving raw materials: straw for hats, yarn for textiles, leather for shoes.

### Women's Role in Textile Production
- 1813: Francis Cabot Lowell began textile production in Waltham, Massachusetts.
- Employed a female workforce.
  - Used b/c of their historical role as textile laborers.
  - Cheap and exploitable supply of labo.
- Placed women's work in a modern industrial production and wage-labor relations. (page 8)

- An extremely successful operation.
  - Independent producers to wage laborers: ushered in industrial capitalism.
  - Created the 'permanent factory population'.

- Women were attracted to factory work by:
  - Relatively high wages.
  - A degree of social independence.
  - Promised protection of corporate paternalism.

### Opposition to Women in the Industrialized Workforce and the Invention of the Cult of Domesticity
- Concern raised over abused English working-class.
  - Lived in miserable conditions and minimal wages.
- Danger posed to the "women's character".
- Lamented changes of coming industrialism.
  - Household labor enshrined as a natural role for women.
  > "Women were the fairer, moral sex whose natural role was the soothe and comfort man." (page 8)
- Vision of a soothing, 'uncorrupted' woman conflicted with women entering labor relations.
  - Amplified class divisions.

- *Cult of domesticity crafted as the antithesis of a working-class creation in America.*
  - Image of 'the lady' emerged.
  - Lower-class women were ignored in the formation of values.

### Feminism and Activism
- Working women felt that they needed to defend their femininity to counteract their exclusion from domesticity.
- Female factory workers were the most radical:
  - Called for equal rights for women's participation in society and employment.
  - Recognized class-based gender oppression.
- Became organizers around labor and women's rights issues. (page 9)

- Some groups were hostile to women's radical claims of equality.
  - Workingmen framed support or opposition in patriarchal attitudes.

### The Fundamental Industrialist Goal
- How to use women's low-cost labor whilst not violating social norms about women's proper spaces? (page 10)
  - Created public spaces for women to work in, but limited civic participation.
  - Emphasized employer oversight and control.

## The Waltham System
- Women's social transformation was dependent on the transformation of labor.
- Disurptions laid the foundation for emergence of Lowell and industrial revolution.
  - 1807 Embargo Act
  - 1812 war with Great Britain
- Merchant capitalists looking to spend their money elsewhere with profitable returns.

### Setbacks and Design
- Worked with partners and investors in Boston to organize a factory system.
  - Each facet of production isolated, but integrated.
- First trial in Waltham, Massachusetts.
- Initial setbacks (page 10):
  - Financing and organizing such a large project.
    - Solved by the 'corporation' legal entity creation.
    - Lowell raised capital and established a hierarchy of authority.
  - Scarcity of labor and stigma of factory work.
    - Derived from the English working-class.
    - Turned to women's labor
- Problem: control.
  - Addressed problems of the 'putting out system'.
  - Concentration of production in one site established control.

### The Need for Female Labor
- Relied on tradition of women's textile work and low cost.
- Used not only to establish social acceptance of women in the workforce, but to establish **control**.
- Factory work had a reputation of being for those with the lowest intelligence and morals.
  - Males were generally repulsed by factory work; viewed as a loss of independence.
- Industrialists looked at marginalized labor sources to fulfill industrial demand.
- **Solution: high wages and moral regulation.**
- High wages:
  - A mill hand could earn in 1836 from 50 to 75 cents per day.
  - After a week, women could take as much as two dollars.
    - Well over other female professions but below that of average male mechanics.
  - High wages and payment in cash were a sharp turn from the putting out system.
    - Waltham system: utilizing patriarchal traditions of subordinating female labor to a male head.
    
- Corporate paternalism & moral regulations:
  - Attempted to make women's industrial work socially acceptable. (page 13)
  - Boardinghouse system pooled labor of women from isolated rural farms located all over New England.
  - Reassured New England communities that women's moral virtue would be safeguarded.
- Boarding house: protected women's morality by:
  - Locking doors at 10 PM
  - Forbidding unapproved visitors
  - Enforcing church attendance
  - Banning 'improper conduct'

### Benefits of the Boardinghouse System
- Boardinghouse system solved the two problems: scarcity and widespread public conern about the protection of moral character. (page 13)
- Also benefited employers. (page 14)
  - When one factory girl led her room into the street in a 1836 strike, the matron was fired for not controlling her.
    - Was a check on improper behavior.
  - Exercised complete control over the girls.

- Any worker who ended work had to recieve an honorable discharge to work again in the industry.
  - Company agents shared blacklist.
  - Advocating for change would place you on the blacklist.
