## Navigate

## Introduction
- November afternoon in 1821: land that was going to become Lowell, Massachusetts.
  - Merrimack & Concord Rivers, Pawtucket falls.
- Two Boston industrialists: **Nathan Appleton** and **Patrick Tracy Jackson**, selecting site for next textile factory.
  - Reshape the countryside, create a city.
- Lowell was *the showcase industrial city of the North*.
  - "City of spindles".
  - Women flooded into the city to take advantage of:
    - High wages and moral paternalism[^1] of corporations.
- Lowell became an industrial powerhouse.

### Broader Themes Across New England's Social Fabric
- Lowell was the footprint of the industrial revolution in the United States.
- This revolution also shaped the social fabric of New England.
- Rise of industrial capitalism:
  - Joined wage labor employment.
  - Disrupted traditional gender roles.
  - Accelerated class stratification[^2].
- **Women** negotiated changes - they were the first industrial labor force.
  - Reliance of textile corporations on female labor based on traditional gender devision of labor in textile work.
    - Employed women for the first time outside the home.

- Social horizons were broadened, cultural restraints on mobility strengthened.

### The Fight for Independence and Social Respect
- Working women of Lowell fought to create independent and socially respected role. (page 2)
- 'Factory girls' fought against gender oppression and labor exploitation.
- Women's secondary social status prevented them from acheiving economic and political rights.
  - Unable to vote.
  - Would face ostracism if they spoke.
- Levied radical critiques of the factory system.
  - Wage labor as 'wage slavery'.
  - Utilized strikes and worker organization.

### The Historical Contradiction
- Historians put feminist and labor movements in 1800-1860.
- Rarely do texts engage with class *and* feminist methods. (page 3)
- Writings about Lowell and feminism:
  - Confine scope to middle-class suffragettes.
  - Ignore rise of industrialism.
    - Stigmatizes working women.
  - Apply narrow class focus.
    - Labor focus is usually at home.
- Reagan: class and labor plays a part in feminism.
  - Marxists tried to place female workers into the workingmen movement. (page 4)
- **New trend of scholarship:** emphasizes important overlap between Marxist and feminist thought.
  > "This essay is an attempt to move in that direction." (page 4)

## Labor and the Cult of Domesticity
- Begins at page 5.
- In colonial and revolutionary eras, a woman's social status was tied to her labor.
  - Families were the unit of economic production.
  - Gender division facilitated production and accomodated farm life.
    - Men labored on staples of family income (crops),women managed and supplied the household.
  - Women's work was vital to the survival of the home.

- Gender division required mutual dependency.
  - Trust: *kept women in respectable positions.*
