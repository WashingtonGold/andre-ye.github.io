## Context
This documents is an Anti-Catholic petition from 97 electors in Washington County, New York to the U.S. Congress, 1837. Source: National Archives, Washington, D.C.

## The Defense Against Corrupt Principles
- Nations fall because of 'fatal disregard of that which ultimately effected their ruin.' (paragraph 1)
- Human institutions are weak against corrupt principles. (paragraph 2)
  - Strength of institutions lies in **intelligence, sound principles, and good morals.**[^2] (paragraph 2)
  - Necessity of watchfulness on principles and measures that can 'subvert the liberties of the State.'

## The Dangers of Foreigners
- America had "equal right of suffrage[^1]", which was the pride and pinnacle of all political institutions. (paragraph 3)
- Easy access of foreigners to vote in the United States were **dangerous to civil and religious liberties.**
  > ...foreigners of doubtful morals and hostile political principles, is a source of danger...
  - Naturalization was too lenient on foreigners.
- Inviting the *speedy attention of Congress.*

## Constitutional Justifications
- Equal right to vote is the **right of a majority to rule.**
- The Constitution did not consider a majority "hostile to its principels" (paragraph 4)
- The United States has principles and institutions to be maintained *in opposition* to a foreigner.
- A right to defend liberties from "foreign invasion."

## Proposed Solutions
- Protecting from 'foreign invasion' by open warfare or 'undercover tactics' to prevent citizenship. (paragraph 4)
- Naturalization laws are protected.
  - Accept the poor and the oppressed, and let America be their asylum.
  > Let us see that those admitted from the lap of tyranny to the right of suffrage with us be indeed the friends of our cherished liberties.
  - Those that are accepted must accept and embrace *American principles*.

## Roman Catholics
- The flow of Roman Catholics from Europe and their admission to citizenship is concerning. (paragraph 5)
- Foreigners "retaining their principles" threatens civil and religious liberties.
- Catholicism - a practice that is persecuting, sanguinary, and encroaching.
- No hostility towards Roman Catholics.[^3] (paragraph 6)
  - Asking no legislation against the religion, but asking 'defensive religion' against its political principels.
  - Combat with education and religious institutions.

## Intolerance Towards Intolerance
- Catholicism advocates for 'political intolerance', therefore the religious liberties of the Constitution dictate intolerance for it.
- Political intolerance does not escape under the guise of religion. (paragraph 7)
- Argues that Roman Catholics tie their religion with their politics.
  - Union of Church and State, "and the subjection of the latter to the former" (paragraph 7)
  - Allegiance to the Pope of Rome.
- Amendments to laws of naturalization to secure free institutions, liberties, "even under the cloak of religion."
