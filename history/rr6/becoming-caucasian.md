## Thesis and Introduction
- Race is thought of as being a feature of the natural landscape and as being biological.
- Instead, racial categories change in response to politica, economic, and social circumstances.
- European immigrants have been racialized and reracialized.
	- This demonstrates the mutability of racial constructions.
- **Argument:** *race is not social but biological.*
	- Why can a white woman have black children but a black woman cannot have white children?
	- What happened to Celts, Slavs, Hebrews, Anglo-Saxons?
	- There is a level of arbitrariness in affixing racial labels.
	- Racial groups *become*. For instanc, Jews became viewed as caucasian.
- **Two premises:**
	1. Race resides not in nature, but in politics and culture.
	2. Race perceptions shift over time, and for particular reasons.
- Non-white groups defined whiteness historically.


## History, Power, and the Mutability of Race
- White privilege has been a 'constant' in American political culture.
	- Whiteness has been subject to all sorts of historical vicissitudes.
	- For instance, Alabama Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a crime of miscegenation because the Sicilian woman was not deemed white.
- A broader pattern of racial thinking persisted in the US between the mid 1800s to the mid 1900s.
- One could be an exotic racial 'other' as well as an acceptable, chivalric European.
	- Usages of 'white', 'Caucasian', and 'Celt' had tremendous overlap.
	- Often, racial designations were also relative to each other.
- Political culture produced a racial order that drew a color line around, rather tehan within Europe. (page 8)
- Race is a theory of history.
	- Who belongs to what and who does not.
	- Who deserves what and who is capable of what.
- Looking at racial categories offers glimpse into theories of history.


### The First Great Epoch: Naturalization Law
- The naturalization law of 1790 limited naturalized citizenship to free white persons.
- Demonstrates 'republican convergence of race and "fitness for self-government"' (page 9)
- Presumed character and unambiguous boundaries of whiteness.
- Demonstrated tasks of citizens in a settler society against 'Indians' and slave rebellions.

### The Second Great Epoch: Altering Authority and Untouched Enlightenment
- American Revolution radically changed lines of authority from the Crown to the people.
- Left untouched Enlightenment assumptions of what 'the people' should be (page 9).
- Demanded moral character from people.
	- Needed to be disciplined, self-sacrificing, productive, wise.
	- Characters inscribed in Euro-American thought.
	> Negro: "idelness, treachery, revenge, debauchery, nastiness." Entry for an encyclopedia in Philadelphia, 1790.
- Citizenship became linked to whiteness naturally.
- This uncomplicated view of whiteness existed until the 1840s.


### The Third Great Epoch: Massive Immigration
- A massive influx of undesirable but white person from Ireland.
	- Caused new interpretations in whiteness.
- Mass European immigration from 1840s until 1924.
	- Whiteness became a hierarchy of plural and scientifically determined white races.
- Questions on whether immigrants were fit for self-government or not.
- *Anglo-Saxon supremacism* replaces simple white supremacy. 
- Restrictive legislation and racial mixing generated by African-American migration.
	- Whiteness was reconsolidated.

### Race as Not Only a Conception But a Perception
- Problem is not how races are comprehended or defined, but how they are seen.
- In racial matters, the "eye that sees" is conditioned by a certain culture.
- Race as an *ideology* resides in its ability to pass from generation to generation.

## A Case Study: Laura Z. Hobson's Gentlemen's Agreement
### The Question of Visuality
- Looking at American Jews' racial "odyssey": from 'Semitic' or 'Hebrew' to 'Caucasian'.
- Laura Z. Hobson's 1947 novel *Gentlemen's Agreement.*

### Plot
A journalist named Philip Green is assigned a series on American anti-Semitism for a major news magazine. He hits upon the idea of posing as a Jew, and writing a piece based on his own experience. He finds that most everyone he knows, including his fiancee, is anti-Semitic.

### Sameness and Difference
- Racialized conceptions of Jewishness.
	- Hobson articulates the theme of reracialization beyond passing and interchangability.
	- Three great divisions of mankind: "Caucasian race, the Mongoloid, the Negroid... There is no Jewish race."
- Franz Boas in 1930s attempted to stir indignation in the scientific communit about German extermination of Jews.
	- Both sides of the Atlantic lamented the method, not the ethnological findings.
- Is decency predicated on sameness?
	- Challenging percieved difference dividing Anglo-Saxon and Hebrew while not touching the differences between "Caucasian" and "Negroid" or "Mongoloid".
- Endorsement of the color-line.
- Provides no syntax for commenting on anti-black racism (page 16)

### Recasting Race as Color
- Racial difference; Caucasian unity won.
- "White races" had significant impact on ideology and perception.
- Politics of justice: not based on sameness, but acceptance of difference.

## Conclusion
- A snapshot in time.
	- Hobson attempts to rethink 'race' but solidifies whiteness.
- Europeans' racial status as "free white persons" were crucial to their entrance.
- Racial inclusion was premised upon the racial exclusion of others.
- European immigration and assimilation was fundamentally racial.
