# Notes on *John Brown's Last Speech*
Andre Ye, 11/7/2020

## Navigate

## Context
> On October, 16, 1859, John Brown and nearly two dozen comrades seized the armory at Harper's Ferry in West Virginia, hoping to use its massive arsenal in the struggle to forcibly end slavery. Captured and brought to trial at nearby Charles Town, Brown was found guilty of treason. One month before his execution, John Brown addressed a courtroom in Charlestown, West Virginia, defending his role in the action at Harper's Ferry. Henry David Thoreau, although himself did not favor violence, praised John Brown, and when the fiery Preacher was sentenced to death, Ralph Waldo emerson said: "He will make the gallows holy as the cross."

## Denial of Intent
- Intended to *free the slaves.*
- In last winter, took slaves from Missouri to Canada "without the snapping of a gun."
  - Intended to the same thing on a larger scale.
- Did not intend murder, treason, or to create a slave insurrection/rebellion[^1].

## Injustice of Penalty
- It is unjust that such a penalty be given to Brown.
- If Brown had successfully completed his plans, it would have been right.
  - Every man in the court would have rewarded instead of punished it.
  > ...so interfered in behalf of the rich, the powerful, the intelligent, the so-called great...
  > ...and suffered and sacrificed what I have in this interference...

## Religious Justification
- The court acknowledges the validity of the law of God.
- The Bible teaches to do unto others what others do to you.
- Teaches to "remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them."
- It was right to interfere on behalf of "His despised poor".
- If it is necessary for life to be removed "...for the furtherance of the ends of justice", then "I submit; so let it be done!"

## Concluding Statements
- Satisfied with treatment on the trial.
  - More generous than expected.
- Feels no consciousness of guilt; never had malicious intent.

> Now I am done.

[^1]: WTF moment. Why wouldn't John Brown want to do so? Wouldn't it be the most effective way of accomplishing his goal? Furthermore, he writes that "I, John Brown, am now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land can never be purged away but with blood." (last words before hanging)
