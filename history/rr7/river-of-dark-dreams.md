## Context

- Published in 2013 at Cambridge, Massachusetts.
- The reading excerpt for class is Chapter 9: *The Mississippi Valley in the Time of Cotton*.
- Every section will be marked by `*Page 244 (excerpt p.2)*`. This indicates that the section information begins on page 244 in the book, or the 2nd page of the PDF given for the class reading.

## The Hidden Capitalism of Slavery
*Page 244 (excerpt p.2)*
- The experience of slaves in the Mississippi Valley seems far from capitalism.
  - Laborered far from the North and England.
- No exploitation under a contract; seems not to be capitalistic.

### Connections Between Slavery of the South and Capitalism of the North
*Page 244 (excerpt p.2)*
> ...lashes into labor into bales into dollars into pounds sterling.
- Planters were not only concerned with profits, but *productivity*.
  - Extracted profit from slaves by economizing on inputs and extending the working day.
- **Between 1820 & 1860, productivity of slave increased 6x** at average cotton plantation.
  - Viewed th ecotton business as a series of sum totals. (days, bales, dollars)
- Cotton business was *less a series of summed-out totals than a set of processes, causes and effects, risks.*

### The Three Sets of Planters' Processes 
*Page 245 (excerpt p.2)*
1. Natural processes by which sun, water, & soil into cotton.
2. Labor process by which cotton plants turned into bales.
3. Financial process by which credit was transformed into income.
  - Planters needed to negotiate exchanges.
- Cotton made at the juncture of these three processes.
  - These forces threatened to escape their control.

### Rate of Conversion
*Page 246 (excerpt p.3)*
- Slaveholders prided themselves at the rate of which their slaes worked.
- Planters worried constantly that slaves were not working hard enough.
- Getting slaves to work harder, faster, and better **required 'supervision' and 'management'**.
- Planter's gaze *ruled by productivity*.
- Only wanted to convert cotton with more efficiency.

### The Labor Calculation
*Page 246 (excerpt p.3)*
- **Bales per acre per hand.**
- Standard mesure widely employed.
- Framed the intensity of cropping cotton and land fertility.
- This formula calcualtes the productivity of *labor*, not total yield.
- *Ecological exhaustion.* The planters were squeezing out more fertility from the land than it could yield; depleting lands to save labor.
> the great limitation to production is labor. -*American Cotton Planter*, 1853

## Slavery as Productivity
*Page 246 (excerpt p.3)*
- 1860s - defenders of slavery pointing to the productivity of labor.
- Bales per acre per hand rose from 4 to 5 to 8, then even 10.
  - the "seeming productiveness of slavery" - David Christy
- Defenders believed productivity of labor to be a *defining feature of Southern civilization*.

### The Aggregate Output Calculation
*Page 247 (excerpt p.3)*
- Pounds per day was an important metric.
- Slaves picked, cleaned, ginned, packed, and shipped millions of pounds of cotton.
- Daily numbers were used to tract deviations at the beginning of the season.
  - Deviated numbers were disciplined.
- If the weight of the cotton falls short in weight, the "[slave] must suffer."

### Violence as the Metric of Production
*Page 248 (excerpt p.4)*
- Failing to make weight, leaving cotton in the boll, breaking branches, spoiling cotton with dirt or twigs, etc. translated onto punishments.
- 15 to 400 lash scale.
- Standard measures of cotton production to measure the speed and efficiency of the process.
- Standards to assess cotton quality: Inferior, Ordinary, Low Middling, Middling, Good Middling, Middling Fair, Fair, Good Fair, Good, Fine.
- Quality dependend on how quickly and carefully a crop was picked and processed.

## The Nature of Cotton
*Page 249 (excerpt p.4)*
- It is important to understand the nature of cotton to understand the rate of slave labor and market grade.
- When cotton bloomed, it continuously diminished in value through exposure.
- e.g. Petit Gulf cotton prized for 'pickability', but was vulnerable to wind.
- Rain could mat cotton fibers together and entangle them
- Cotton near the bottom of the plant could be splahed with mud.
- Frost could stain the cotton deep red.
- Blood from fingers from the rough husks of cotton bolls could stain fibers.

### Quality Escapes Measuring Cotton with a Quantitative Metric
*Page 250 (excerpt p.5)*
- Pounds per day was convenient for biological process of diminishing value.
- However, the metric was a poor template of the crop's quality.
- Slaves knew work were *measured by the pound*, had little incentive to pick clean cotton.
  - Gathered leaves and stems with bolls, dragged sacks over soil, emptied them ont he ground at the end of the row, packed them down with muddy feet, etc.
- This metric did not emphasize quality.

### High Standards and Classifications of Cotton During Sale
*Page 250 (excerpt p.5)*
- Classified by *color* and *staple* - length & strength of strands, how finely it could be woven.
- Impressions were hand counted and often determined by the eye.
- Attempted to make slaves embody metropolitan standards of cotton.
  - In the gin house, slaves determined which cotton was ready to be ginned.
- Cotton went to the market in *bales*.
  - Shape and condition determined its merchantability.
  - Cotton bales were large and heavy. Often reached market with damage.
  - Cotton that was explosed to rain would ruin it.
  - Improperly sorted cotton would compromise sales.

#### Poor and Fraudulent Packing
*Page 251 (excerpt p.5)*
- Of great concern to buyers and brokers in Atlantic cotton market.
- Torn bagging makes the cotton "trashy and worthless".
- Careless packaging caused a discrepancy between "sample and the bulk".
- Adjudication of capitalists were phrased on this.

#### Thesis of Section
Cotton planters were not ignorant of standards of the market; they were capitalists operating in a capitalistic sphere. Planters watched sharply over their slaves and strictly managed and balanced influences of ecology, labor, and finance. 

## Where Slave-Owning Planters Capitalists?
*Page 252 (excerpt p.6)*
- Few discussion has been had on this topic.

### The Argument Against Slaveowners as Capitalists
*Page 252 (excerpt p.6)*
- Capitalism emerged in the 17th century, characterized by separation of laborers from the land, and the **commodification of labor power).
  - Performance of work by an hourly wage.
  - e.g. factory system of production.
- From these premises, one cannot argue that slavery was capitalist.

### The Argument For Slaveowners as Capitalists
*Page 252 (excerpt p.6)*
- Capitalism as a global system of commerce and exchange that emerged long before the industrial revolution.
- How else could the slave-produced commodities be produced?
  - Slavery was then hence unquestionably capitalist.

### Compare and Contrast of the Two Positions
*Page 253 (excerpt p.6)*

| Position | Virtues and Positives |
| --- | --- |
| Against | Virtue of specificity. Locates emergence of capitalism at a specific time and place. <br> Places working people at the center of capitalism. |
| For | Represents simultaneous and interdependent economic histories of Europe, Africa, Americas, and Asia. <br> Focuses on exchange.

| Position | Criticism |
| --- | --- |
| Against | Eurocentric. Treats history of capitalism in England as global. Subordinates other histories. <br> Treats enslavement in Africa as primary accumulation. <br> Claims are not universal. |
| For | Treats capitalism as a series of markers regardless the sphere of production. Do the differences in designations of slaves and wage-earning works not matter? <br> Capitalism *must* distinguish between slave and free labor. |
