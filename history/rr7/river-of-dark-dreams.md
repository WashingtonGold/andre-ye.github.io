- The reading excerpt for class is Chapter 9: *The Mississippi Valley in the Time of Cotton*.
- Every section will be marked by `*Page 244 (excerpt p.2)*`. This indicates that the section information begins on page 244 in the book, or the 2nd page of the PDF given for the class reading.

## The Hidden Capitalism of Slavery
*Page 244 (excerpt p.2)*
- The experience of slaves in the Mississippi Valley seems far from capitalism.
  - Laborered far from the North and England.
- No exploitation under a contract; seems not to be capitalistic.

### Connections Between Slavery of the South and Capitalism of the North
*Page 244 (excerpt p.2)*
> ...lashes into labor into bales into dollars into pounds sterling.
- Planters were not only concerned with profits, but *productivity*.
  - Extracted profit from slaves by economizing on inputs and extending the working day.
- **Between 1820 & 1860, productivity of slave increased 6x** at average cotton plantation.
  - Viewed th ecotton business as a series of sum totals. (days, bales, dollars)
- Cotton business was *less a series of summed-out totals than a set of processes, causes and effects, risks.*

### The Three Sets of Planters' Processes 
*Page 245 (excerpt p.2)*
1. Natural processes by which sun, water, & soil into cotton.
2. Labor process by which cotton plants turned into bales.
3. Financial process by which credit was transformed into income.
  - Planters needed to negotiate exchanges.
- Cotton made at the juncture of these three processes.
  - These forces threatened to escape their control.

### Rate of Conversion
*Page 246 (excerpt p.3)*
- Slaveholders prided themselves at the rate of which their slaes worked.
- Planters worried constantly that slaves were not working hard enough.
- Getting slaves to work harder, faster, and better **required 'supervision' and 'management'**.
- Planter's gaze *ruled by productivity*.
- Only wanted to convert cotton with more efficiency.

### The Labor Calculation
*Page 246 (excerpt p.3)*
- **Bales per acre per hand.**
- Standard mesure widely employed.
- Framed the intensity of cropping cotton and land fertility.
- This formula calcualtes the productivity of *labor*, not total yield.
- *Ecological exhaustion.* The planters were squeezing out more fertility from the land than it could yield; depleting lands to save labor.
> the great limitation to production is labor. -*American Cotton Planter*, 1853

## Slavery as Productivity
*Page 246 (excerpt p.3)*
- 1860s - defenders of slavery pointing to the productivity of labor.
- Bales per acre per hand rose from 4 to 5 to 8, then even 10.
  - the "seeming productiveness of slavery" - David Christy
- Defenders believed productivity of labor to be a *defining feature of Southern civilization*.

### The Aggregate Output Calculation
*Page 247 (excerpt p.3)*
- Pounds per day was an important metric.
- Slaves picked, cleaned, ginned, packed, and shipped millions of pounds of cotton.
- Daily numbers were used to tract deviations at the beginning of the season.
  - Deviated numbers were disciplined.
- If the weight of the cotton falls short in weight, the "[slave] must suffer."

### Violence as the Metric of Production
*Page 248 (excerpt p.4)*
- Failing to make weight, leaving cotton in the boll, breaking branches, spoiling cotton with dirt or twigs, etc. translated onto punishments.
- 15 to 400 lash scale.
- Standard measures of cotton production to measure the speed and efficiency of the process.
- Standards to assess cotton quality: Inferior, Ordinary, Low Middling, Middling, Good Middling, Middling Fair, Fair, Good Fair, Good, Fine.
- Quality dependend on how quickly and carefully a crop was picked and processed.

## The Nature of Cotton
*Page 249 (excerpt p.4)*
- It is important to understand the nature of cotton to understand the rate of slave labor and market grade.
- When cotton bloomed, it continuously diminished in value through exposure.
- e.g. Petit Gulf cotton prized for 'pickability', but was vulnerable to wind.
- Rain could mat cotton fibers together and entangle them
- Cotton near the bottom of the plant could be splahed with mud.
- Frost could stain the cotton deep red.
- Blood from fingers from the rough husks of cotton bolls could stain fibers.

### Quality Escapes Measuring Cotton with a Quantitative Metric
*Page 250 (excerpt p.5)*
- Pounds per day was convenient for biological process of diminishing value.
- However, the metric was a poor template of the crop's quality.
- Slaves knew work were *measured by the pound*, had little incentive to pick clean cotton.
  - Gathered leaves and stems with bolls, dragged sacks over soil, emptied them ont he ground at the end of the row, packed them down with muddy feet, etc.
- This metric did not emphasize quality.

### High Standards and Classifications of Cotton During Sale
*Page 250 (excerpt p.5)*
- Classified by *color* and *staple* - length & strength of strands, how finely it could be woven.
- Impressions were hand counted and often determined by the eye.
- Attempted to make slaves embody metropolitan standards of cotton.
  - In the gin house, slaves determined which cotton was ready to be ginned.
- Cotton went to the market in *bales*.
  - Shape and condition determined its merchantability.
  - Cotton bales were large and heavy. Often reached market with damage.
  - Cotton that was explosed to rain would ruin it.
  - Improperly sorted cotton would compromise sales.

#### Poor and Fraudulent Packing
*Page 251 (excerpt p.5)*
- Of great concern to buyers and brokers in Atlantic cotton market.
- Torn bagging makes the cotton "trashy and worthless".
- Careless packaging caused a discrepancy between "sample and the bulk".
- Adjudication of capitalists were phrased on this.

#### Thesis of Current Section
Cotton planters were not ignorant of standards of the market; they were capitalists operating in a capitalistic sphere. Planters watched sharply over their slaves and strictly managed and balanced influences of ecology, labor, and finance. 

## Where Slave-Owning Planters Capitalists?
*Page 252 (excerpt p.6)*
- Few discussion has been had on this topic.

### The Argument Against Slaveowners as Capitalists
*Page 252 (excerpt p.6)*
- Capitalism emerged in the 17th century, characterized by separation of laborers from the land, and the **commodification of labor power).
  - Performance of work by an hourly wage.
  - e.g. factory system of production.
- From these premises, one cannot argue that slavery was capitalist.

### The Argument For Slaveowners as Capitalists
*Page 252 (excerpt p.6)*
- Capitalism as a global system of commerce and exchange that emerged long before the industrial revolution.
- How else could the slave-produced commodities be produced?
  - Slavery was then hence unquestionably capitalist.

### Compare and Contrast of the Two Positions
*Page 253 (excerpt p.6)*

| Position | Virtues and Positives |
| --- | --- |
| Against | Virtue of specificity. Locates emergence of capitalism at a specific time and place. <br> Places working people at the center of capitalism. |
| For | Represents simultaneous and interdependent economic histories of Europe, Africa, Americas, and Asia. <br> Focuses on exchange.

| Position | Criticism |
| --- | --- |
| Against | Eurocentric. Treats history of capitalism in England as global. Subordinates other histories. <br> Treats enslavement in Africa as primary accumulation. <br> Claims are not universal. |
| For | Treats capitalism as a series of markers regardless the sphere of production. Do the differences in designations of slaves and wage-earning works not matter? <br> Capitalism *must* distinguish between slave and free labor. |

### Reframing the Argument in Light of the Two Positions
*Page 254 (excerpt p.7)*
- A materialist and historical analysis begins from the fact that there was no 19th century capitalism without slavery.
- Industrial slavery, however, it *may* have developed w/o solave-produced cotton and Southern capital markets, did not develop that way.
- One cannot extract the history of industrial development from its entanglement with slavery and label the former capitalist and the latter 'precapitalist' or 'noncapitalist'.
- **Understand more concretely the workings of the market.**
  - Set aside prefabricated questions and begin with *the bale of cotton.

## The Bale of Cotton
*Page 254 (excerpt p.7)*
- Numbers are representations of real bales of cotton; abstractions of progress.
  - Bales per acre per hand.
  - Bales sent to market.
  - Drayage.
  - Insurance.
  - Storage.
  - Price per pound.
- The commercial standard of the cotton trade is the *bale*.
  - However, the weight is not uniform.
  - There is almost not standard of capacity that is uniform for the bale.

### American Cotton Powering the World Economy
*Page 255 (excerpt p.7)*
- The American cotton dominated global supply of cotton and a large portion of global economic activity.
  - From little cotton in end of 18th century to 2nd quarter of 19th.

### The Cotton Gin
*Page 255 (excerpt p.7)*
- In 1794, the cotton gin was invented.
  - Credited to Eli Whitney, although is contested.
- Provided cotton planters with a machine that could remove seeds entangled in each bool.
- Made it possible to cultivate cotton profitably in large portions of the Southern US.
- High prices of cotton produced the greatest economic boom in the nation's century.
- 1821; Mississippi and Louisiana produced 20 million pounds of cotton.
- 1859; that numbers was about 864 million pounds.
- **Cotton and slavery went together.**

### The Slave Market and the Cotton Market
*Page 256 (excerpt p.8)*
- Prices in the slave market varied directly with that of the cotton market.
  - This was no surprise in an economy where planters determined productivity of labor in cotton rather than in currency.

### New Orleans
*Page 256 (excerpt p.8)*
- Cotton produced by slaves in the Mississippi Valley made their way through the market into the port of New Orleans.
- Cotton economy grew; river traffic on the Mississippi grew correspondingly.
- New Orleans was an export-processing zone mediating the Cotton Kingdom (of the Mississippi) and the Atlantic.
- New Orleans workers unloaded hundreds of thousands of bales of cotton from steamboats.
  - Cotton was weighed, sampled, and sold.

### Cotton Markets and Global Pathways
*Page 257 (excerpt p.8)*
- Not all cotton shipped directly from the Mississippi Valley to Great Britain directly across the Atlantic.  
- Cotton from New Orleans might take several paths to the market.
  - 15% of Southern cotton was annually sold to domestic manufactures (usually in New England).
    - This was a small portion of the global cotton trade.
    - Accounted for a large portion of the industrial output of the United States.
  - 85% of the crop was shipped directly from New Orleans across the Atlantic to Liverpool.
- Lots of cotton was shipped to New York, where it wasa unloaded, inspected, consigned, reloaded, then shipped across the Atlantic.
- Southern cotton reached Europe by way of New York.

### New York and the Cotton Trade
*Page 257 (excerpt p.8)*
- New York attained large control over the cotton trade.
  - This was a concern to pro-slavery analysts of the cotton trade more than any other concern had been.
- Commercial spaces of the nineteenth century were **made, not given**.
  - Distance measured not in miles but dollars.
  - New York's banks were able to offer longer credit on better terms to those interested in buying cotton.
- Slower rates of money paid for cotton degraded; this could compensate for the longer distance the cotton would have to travel to market.
- A large existing volume of trade between New York and Liverpool.
  - Government had granted New York a monopoly over the mail service to Great Britain.
  - Enabled regularly schedule ships to operate at a profit. 
- US imported lots from Great Britain but exported very little other than cotton; it was in the interest of packets to ship cotton at lower rates than competitors.
- Lowered the per-pound rate for shipping cotton to Liverpool via New York; shortened the distance cotton travelled to the market.
  - Measured in dollars, New Orleans to New York to Liverpool was shorter than travelling directly (measured in miles).

## The Banking System of Slavery and Capital
*Page 259 (excerpt p.9)*
- Agriculturalists that create the wealth of the country do not get daily receipts of money; their produce is ready only once a year.
- Required supplies to be purchased **on credit** year round.
- Banking system of the country based around this bill movement of produce.
- Debts represented a dimension of linkages between Mississippi Valley.
- Capital entered the Mississippi Valley in the winter months when cotton was sold.
- Crops came to markets in New Orlenas; cotton merchants (often agents of merchant banks in NY or Liverpool) provided advances for eventual sale.
- **In return for lending factors, the cotton merchants recieved the right to sell it on a consignment basis.**
  - Perhaps earning the right to ship it aboard their own ships.
- Credit took the form of a sight draft payable in NY or Liverpool.

### Credit and Debt
*Page 260 (excerpt p.10)*
- Credit extended by merchant houses revolved the complexity of trade into liquidity.
- Planters in Louisiana and Mississippi were able to pay their debts when they delivered their crop.
- American importers were able to buy debt that they could use to pay for European imports.
- Foreign exchange cycled from the Deep South in the fal to the North in the winter.
- Bills entered a transatlantic money market.
  - Paid for finished goods imported to Great Britain, where cotton was shipped to a market where it was sampled, graded, and sold to a manufacturer.

*Page 263 (excerpt p.11)*
- Even a good crop did not protect a planter if he could not get it to market in time.
- Even when crops were gathered, ginned, packed, and shipped, cotton planters were substantially exposed.
  - Bore the risks of the global market.
- Cotton was sold on consignment; planters retained legal ownership to the time it was sold.
- Could find themselves demanded for money they had already paid; front of the debt chain.

### Supplies and Costs
*Page 261 (excerpt p.10)*
- A working plantation needed many things:
  - Rough-cut shoes worn by slaves
  - Salt pork for their rations
  - Cornish hens and French wins for the planter
  - Schoolbooks for his children
  - Ribbons for his wife hair
  - Hoes to cut graph
  - Baling wire to pack cotton
  - etc.
- Planter's indebtedness to merchants was "common sense".
- In the form of plantation supplies, consumable goods, or cash advanced, money that factors lent to planters was not their own.
  - Borrowed from banks in New Orleans, New York, or even Liverpool.
  - A fictional stream of capital.
- Provided the factor with credit that could be used to pay for goods over the course of the year.
- Drafts promising payment at a specified date could be "discounted"[^1] by local bankers and money changers.
  - Credit allowed temporal and spatial unevenness of the cotton market to be smoothed out.
  
#### Example
*Page 261 (excerpt p.10)*
A planter who needed cotton seed in March could have it purchased by a factor in New Orleans, who could buy it with money borrowed from a bank in New York.

When the seed grew into cotton, it will be shipped to the factor, who would sell the cotton and use the proceeds to cover his own debt to the bank. When the sale of cotton was insufficient, the factor would roll the debt to the next year's crop.

Factor rates:

| Interest | 8% |
| Commission | 2.5% |

### Absorbment of Risk at the End of the Debt Chain
*Page 261 (excerpt p.10)*
- The network of advances and consignments structured the cotton trade with a small risk on the end of the chain of debt.
- Factors and merchant-bankers were able to make money off the cotton trade *while absorbing very little risk.*

*Page 262 (excerpt p.11)*
- Merchant bankers could require borrowers to obtain an endorsement.
  - 'Accomodating endorsers' would be liable for debt if principal borrower defaulted.
- Endorsers lent their creditworthiness to the borrower; *eased the flow of capital into the economy.*
- Endorsement respatialized and recapitalized risk by using local networks of trade and sociability to insulate merchant bankers.

#### The Brown Brothers
*Page 262 (excerpt p.11)*
- One of the largest firms heavily involved in the cotton trade. 
- Tried to limit risk by advancing only 3/4 of the value theye xpected cotton would eventually bring.
- Brown Brothers rarely purchased cotton on the company's account.
  - Distributed risk through a network of factors and cotton brokers.
  - Lent them money and recieved guaranteed consignments.

## Realities of the Ecosystem and Debt
*Page 262 (excerpt p.11)*
###  Weather
*Page 262 (excerpt p.11)*
- Rain or high wind after cotton bloomed would diminish the value of the crop.
- Severe storms, cold springs, and droughts could leave plants small and the bolls few.
- Too much sun in the middle of the season could cause a crop ot wither.
- Too much rain could drown it.
- Late spring meant that the crop bloomed 'behind'.
- Early frost meant that picking season would be cut short.

### Bugs and Pests
*Page 263 (excerpt p.11)*
- Narrowing of genetic spectrum of Southern cotton meant it was more vulnerable to insects and parasites.
- "Rust and rot" were the primary threats to the cotton plant.
  - "Rust" gave the leaves a brown and deadened tinge.
  - "Rot" attacked the boll; indicated the presence of worms.
- "Army worm"; cannot be exterminated.

### Self-Imposed Biological Feedback Loop
*Page 263 (excerpt p.11)*
- Planters sough to *revise ecological limits* of a slave-based economic practice by using *hybridized seed.*
- This created a biological feedback loop that threatened to ruin crops.

### Transportation Issues
*Page 264 (excerpt p.12)*
- Physical properties of cotton made it vulnerable to 'going bad' in the field.
  - Cotton could be 'skidded' across a muddy embankment,
  - Exposed to weather,
  - Warehoused underneath a leaking rough,
  - Partially eaten by cattle.
- Cotton went to market in a 'reckless' way: rafts often were not careful with the luggage and ruined cotton.

*Page 270 (excerpt p.15)*
- Even if cotton was stowed in the hold of a ship, it could be delayed by low water and miss the high prices of the season.


#### Paper Packaging to Address Physical Vulnerabilities
*Page 265 (excerpt p.12)*
- Much of factor business involved encasing bales of cotton in a protective coating.
- Vulnerable physical properties were accompanied by paper guarantees of weight and quality, partitions of ownership and risk, designations of responsibility, etc.
- **The 'merchantability' of cotton was rendered separable from its physical form: volatile cotton was determined to be commercially stable.**
  - Factors collapsed the dimensionality of time in the cotton market into timeliness, focusing on being in the right place at the right time.

## Speculation
*Page 266 (excerpt p.13)*
- Cotton was stabilized by commercial paper.
- This made it a good medium for speculation.
### The Cotton Market
*Page 266 (excerpt p.13)*
- Cotton market had tremendous volatility.
- Prices often varied 10 to 15 percent within a month.
- Difference between a good crop and a good one could be determined by where the sale of one's cotton fell on a seasonal price curve.

### Statistics and Predicting the Future
*Page 267 (excerpt p.13)*
- Buyers and sellers in the cotton market began the season by trying to estimate the size of the previous year's crop.
- These numbers helped planters and merchants imagine the future.
  - Would there be a shortage of cotton?
  - Would the bulk of the crop come in the middle of the season?
- Mastering the cotton trade requires factors to imagine the arc of the cotton market.

### Estimating the Size of Total Cotton Crop
*Page 268 (excerpt p.14)*
- A crucial aspect of trader's speculation.
- New Orlenas firms sent agent into the countryside to track the growth of crop in the field.
- Factors that could determine the size of the crop:
  - Too much rain in Alabama.
  - Rain and rust in Georgia.
  - The boll worm in Eastern Mississippi.
  - etc.

### Information as Currency
*Page 269 (excerpt p.14)*
- Planters would sell their cotton, then talk up the size of their crop.
- Cotton market subject to pull of stories told about it.
  - Published reports and tables turne dto rumors and gossip.
- Rumor and gossip at one end of the season became news and intelligence of history.
- 1825: NY speculators exploited gap in news and newspaper by paying a postal contractor to transmit cotton purchase orders while holding mail containing news from Europe, upon which their bets were based.
- Telegraphy in 1840s evened geographic access to market information.

*Page 271 (excerpt p.15)*
- Cotton could arrive at the market on the wave of rising prices.
  - News of a short crop, long credit, expanding worldwide demand.
- If the time was right, cotton planters could make considerable profit.
- Cotton planters were often compared to gamblers.
> They turn the farmer's life into that of a gambler and speculator. -Lousiana journalist.
- Dependent upon chances and evil cards - bad seasons, fall in prices, etc.

## Factor-Planter Relationships
### Planter Control Over Markets
*Page 271 (excerpt p.15)*
- Planters were legally but not physically present at the sale of their cotton.
- Crucial decisions where usually made by factors.
- Planter scould exert control over the sale of their crop by *holding it back from the market*.
- Crops could be held back when planters believed it was going to be short
- Cotton being held back into country in anticipation of higher prices was a source of uncertainty.
  - Cotton factors urged planters to send crops further for sale.
- When the market was active, it was best to ship cotton to catch the save.
- When the market was dull, it was best to ship cotton so that it was available whent hings began to move.

*Page 272 (excerpt p.16)*
- Planters could gamble on rhythm of cotton season by withholding cotton.
- Could not, however, stop the flow of time.
- Always another crop gathering at their back.

### Factor Divergence of Interests
*Page 272 (excerpt p.16)*
- Factors handled multiple crops and made their money on commission.
  - Had less of a stake in any particular transaction.
- Income depended on maximizing the volume of sales, instead of maximizing the value of any one sale.

### Planter Control Over Sales
*Page 273 (excerpt p.16)*
- Once crop was sent, planters could control the shipment of cotton with written guidelines. 
- e.g. hold onto cotton until it reaches *x* price, then sell.
- A factor that sold cotton for less than that price **could be held legally liable for the difference** between that obtained and the one specified by the planter.
- Cotton held a risk of not being sold.
  - Generally planters allowed factors discretion in marketing cotton.

### Lack of Information to Planters
*Page 274 (excerpt p.17)*
- Information about a crop was often given the planters in writing.
- Formulations gestureda t daily business of the cotton market.
  - Even if they drew specifics, likely speculation.
- Factors had not seen the bales themselves.
  - Actions they took in the cotton market was shrouded in speculation.
> Merchants act advisedly - planters in the dark.
- Mishandling of crops could become subjects of lawsuits.

### Lack of Trust Between Planters and Factors
*Page 275 (excerpt p.17)*
- Cotton planters often doubted the honesty of factors.
- Cotton merchants as "Southern Yankees".
- New Orlenas merchants had creative accounting, heavy charging.
- Planters believed agents would be dishonest:
  - Record sales at a lower rate in their books,
  - Deduct a half-cent on the rest,
  - Launder goods they owned themselves through third-party sellers.
- For instance, erred recordings in factor books: William Brandon *owed* $6,000 instead of being $6,000 in debt.
- Interest of planters may have been sacrificed (sold short) at any chain of advance purchase and promised payment.
- Cotton was regularly 'slaughtered' for capital.

## Planter Denial of Responsibility, Self-Perception, and Agency
*Page 277 (excerpt p.18)*
- Planters would often credit themselvs for good prices and high cotton returns.
- Terms like "management", "skill', "diligence", etc. reflected an image of wordly success.
- "I"-language used extensively.
- When return was low, the services like factors were not supports but contraints on freedom.
- When times were bad, planters beat their slaves and blamed merchants.
- Plants emphasized **loss of control** over their own affairs.
