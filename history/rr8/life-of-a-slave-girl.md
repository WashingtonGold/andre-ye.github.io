  - Author prefered the stormy moods.
  - Dr. Flint attempted to corrupt pure principles.
- Daily, Dr. Flint "violated the most sacred commandments of nature."
  - Told the author that she was his property.
- Soul yearned to revolt, but could not turn for protection.
  - No shadow of law to protect a slave from violence or even death.
  - The mistress feels jealousy and rage towards slaves.
- If the North knew about the true degredation of slavery, "you... would not help to tighten the yoke."
  - Northerners would refuse to do for the master that the "lowest class of whites" do for "the master" in the South. [^3]
- Even the young child must learn why her mistress hates her so much.
  - Will be compelled to realize that she is no longer a child.
  - God bestowing beauty upon her is the greatest curse.
    > That which commands admiration in the white woman only hastens the degradation of the female slave.
- The master's presence hovered over the slave at every turn.
- If author talked to her grandmother, master would kill her.
  - Felt guilty telling grandmother such "guilty things".
  - Although did not confide in her, felt comforted by grandmother's presence.
- Even as the laws and customs were egregious in the slaveholding community, professional men deemed it prudent to keep up some show of decency.
- Goal: to kindle a flame of compassion for the "sisters who are still in bondage, suffering as I once suffered."
- In light of these actions, why are the free men and women of the North silent?
  > God bless those, every where, who are laboring to advance the cause of humanity!
