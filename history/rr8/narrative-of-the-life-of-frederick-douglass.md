## Context
- Complete title: *Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave. Written by Himself*.
- Published in Boston by the Anti-Slavery Office in 185.
- Frederick Douglass was born into slavery on Maryland's Eastern Shore in 1818. He escaped from slavery at age 20 and became an active figure in the abolitionist movement, eventually becoming one of the most important black American figures of the 19th century. In these excerpts from his first autobiography, he describes his experiences as a slave.

## Chapter 2
- Slaves of all other farms recieved allowance of food and clothing.
  - Monthly allowance: 8 pounds of pork and one bushel of corn meal.
  - Yearly clothing: no more than 7 dollars of cost.
- Children who could not work in the field had only two coarse linen shirts per year.
  - Went naked until the next allowance day otherwise.
- No beds given to the sleep. Minimal sleeping time was given.
- At the sound of the driver's horn, all must rise to the field.
  - No age or sex finds any favor.
- Mr. Severe - an overseer.
  - Whipped a woman, causing the blood to run half an hour at a time, in the midst of her crying children.
  - A profane swearer.

## Chapter 7
- Lived in Master Hugh's family for about 7 years.
- Succeeded in learning how to read and write.
  - Needed to formulate many strategies.
- Mistress was kind-hearted; this was a contradiction to slavery, in which human relationships could not be human.
- Under slavery, the mistress hardened.
  - Ceased to instruct the author.
  - Became more violent and easily angered.
- Plan adopted: made friends with the little white boys met in the street.
  - These became teachers; author brought books and bread.
- The bread given to the poor white boys was returned with the "more valuable bread of knowledge."

- Proposed a Sabbath school for slaves, but were rejected.
- Master found religious sanction in his cruelty.
  - Master tied up a young woman and whipped her, in justification with a passage from the Scripture.
- Master Thoomas - one of many slaveholders who held slaves for the purpose of taking care of them.

## Chapter 10
- Mr. Covey was at the house; when the fan stopped, he came immediately.
  - Author had crawled away in hope to find relief from the sun.
  - Was kicked and told to get up; then gave a heavy blow to the head.
- Resolved to go to the master, enter a complaint, and ask for his protection.
  - Needed to walk 7 miles; a evere undertaking.
  - Had sickness and was feeble from the violence.
- Covey discovered him and threatened if he did not return.
- Upon arrival, was told that he deserved the punishment by Covey.
  - Gave him many salts and was told to return to Mr. Covey's in the morning.
- In the morning, ran into the cornfield - the high corn afforded a means of hiding.
  - That night, fell with Sandy Jenkins; had a free wife who lived about four miles from Mr. Covey's.
  - Invited him to go home with Jenkins.
- Afterward, had a fight with Mr. Covey; was a turning-point in career as a slave.
  - Rekindled feelings of freedom and revivd a feeling of manhood.
- Was never whipped again, albeit involved in several fights.
- Theory: reputation at stake, suffered him to go unpunished.
