## Introduction
*Page 2*
- War was murder, anarchy, and debt; it results in evil despite intended good.
- Before 1861, neither the North nor the South had an intention of going to war.
  - Were not prepared for war.
  - National army small, poorly equipped, did not have experience.
- Northern armies did not intend to become armies of emancipation.
  - Did not propose to attack property or to free slaves.
  - Was a war to preserve the Union.
  
## Motivation for the War
*page 2*
- Slavery did not touch the heart of American masses.
  - Common men did not understand the political and economic cost of slavery.
  - **The Northern white population did not fight against slavery.**
  - Free soil was a stronger motive
  - Large economic ideal of keeping a large market for goods; the United States appealed to the West and the North.
    - Additionally appealed to broder states.
```
To the flag we are pledged, all its foes we abhor,
And we ain't for the n*****, but we are here for the war.
```

### Economic Incentives
*page 3*
- Border States wanted to cotton belt in the Union.
  - Allowed surplus slaves to be sold.
- Wanted to be in the same union with the North and West; profit of trade was increasing.
  - Saving the Union was a rallying cry of war; made the Border States hesitate secession to the South.
  - Knew that the only prescription was abolition.
- If the South had trained leadership, a compromise would have been made.
  - Would have rendered the slave system impregnable for generations.

### Ignoring Interests of Minorities
*page 3*
- North and South ignored interests of the laboring class.
  - North expected patriotism and union.
  - South expected all white men to defend slaveholder property.
  - Both expected a sharp, quick fight.
    - South expected to secede peaceably and impose terms that recognized slavery.
    - North expected South would return with slave property recognized but geographically limited.
- Both ignored slaves.
  - The North saw slaves as a 'curiosity'.
  - Black slaves not considered important by a majority.

## The Importance of Slaves
*page 4*
- Black slaves occupied the center stage.
  - The war occurred in the South; there were ~4 million black slaves and ~260,000 free blacks.
    - What did war mean to them? What did they mean to the war?
- Two theories:
  - Black slaves faithfully served until emancipation was thrust upon them.
  - Black slaves immediately left serfdom and took their stand with freedom.
- 9/10 of the black slaves could not read or write.
  - Most isolated; mass movement would occur slowly.
  - Black slaves waited, looked, and listened.
    - No use seeking refuge in "an army which was not the army of freedom".

### Fugitive Slaves
*page 4*
- When it became clear that the Union armies would not return fugitives, slaves entered in a general strike.
- Ran away to safety and offered services to the Federal Army.
- Served the emancipating army.

### Southern Dependence on Slaves
*page 4*
- The South was heavily dependent on black slaves to raqise food and money for civillians and the army.
  - The South ignored the idea that slaves would want to be rescued.
  - Convinced the slaves did not want tob e free.
- South made a careful calculation of military value of slaves.
  - Slaves would run throughout the war.
  - In the industrial North, the men fighting would be workers and laborers that ran it.
  - The institution of slavery was a strong economic weapon.

#### Military Usage
*page 5*
- The South considered using slaves as military labor.
  - Would throw up breastworks, transport and prepare food, act as servants.
  - Authorized slaves to work on military construction.
  - Texas: 1,000 slaves offerred by planters to work on public defenses.
  - Pondering military use as soldiers.
- *Slavery softened as the war proceeded.*
  - Some level of harshness had to disappear; women and children were mainly left.
  - **The condition of the slave had changed**, no matter who won the war.
- The South needed to be careful; assured them of the bad character of the North.
