## Context
- Complete title: *Black Reconstruction: An Essay Toward a History of the Part Which Black Folk Played in the Attempt to Reconstruct Democracy in America, 1860-1880*
- By W.E. Burghardt Du Bois, professor of sociology in the Atlanta University.
- Published by Harcourt, Brace and Company in New York.
- Page numbers reference the PDF given in class.
- Excerpt from in class is Chapter IV: The General Strike.

## Summary and Key Points
- Theory: Black slaves escaped the South to the North because they did not want to work anymore.
  - Arising contradiction: Black slaves were better off in plantations than following a Northern army around, fugitives were ill-treated in the North.
- Thesis: Instead, *Black slaves objected not to work itself but the **conditions** of work.*
  - They were willing to work the same plantation work for the North, but when principles of honesty in treatment and education were fulfilled.
  - Wanted to see the toils of their own work.
- Timeline:
  - Beginnings of the Civil War. The Northern army initially *does not aim to fight against slavery*.
  - Fugitive slaves begin approaching Northern troops in large numbers. Some officials in the Northern arm see labor potential and set them to work.
    - Slaves are still often ill-treated.
  - More fugitive slaves continue to arrive. As the white Northern soldier grew tired, the fugitive slave became a military laborer.
  - From slavery-passive to employing fugitive slaves in the army, the North's transition 

## Introduction
*Page 2*
- War was murder, anarchy, and debt; it results in evil despite intended good.
- Before 1861, neither the North nor the South had an intention of going to war.
  - Were not prepared for war.
  - National army small, poorly equipped, did not have experience.
- Northern armies did not intend to become armies of emancipation.
  - Did not propose to attack property or to free slaves.
  - Was a war to preserve the Union.
  
## Initial Motivation for the War
*page 2*
- Slavery did not touch the heart of American masses.
  - Common men did not understand the political and economic cost of slavery.
  - **The Northern white population did not fight against slavery.**
  - Free soil was a stronger motive
  - Large economic ideal of keeping a large market for goods; the United States appealed to the West and the North.
    - Additionally appealed to broder states.
```
To the flag we are pledged, all its foes we abhor,
And we ain't for the n*****, but we are here for the war.
```

### Economic Incentives
*page 3*
- Border States wanted to cotton belt in the Union.
  - Allowed surplus slaves to be sold.
- Wanted to be in the same union with the North and West; profit of trade was increasing.
  - Saving the Union was a rallying cry of war; made the Border States hesitate secession to the South.
  - Knew that the only prescription was abolition.
- If the South had trained leadership, a compromise would have been made.
  - Would have rendered the slave system impregnable for generations.

### Ignoring Interests of Minorities
*page 3*
- North and South ignored interests of the laboring class.
  - North expected patriotism and union.
  - South expected all white men to defend slaveholder property.
  - Both expected a sharp, quick fight.
    - South expected to secede peaceably and impose terms that recognized slavery.
    - North expected South would return with slave property recognized but geographically limited.
- Both ignored slaves.
  - The North saw slaves as a 'curiosity'.
  - Black slaves not considered important by a majority.

## The Importance of Slaves
*page 4*
- Black slaves occupied the center stage.
  - The war occurred in the South; there were ~4 million black slaves and ~260,000 free blacks.
    - What did war mean to them? What did they mean to the war?
- Two theories:
  - Black slaves faithfully served until emancipation was thrust upon them.
  - Black slaves immediately left serfdom and took their stand with freedom.
- 9/10 of the black slaves could not read or write.
  - Most isolated; mass movement would occur slowly.
  - Black slaves waited, looked, and listened.
    - No use seeking refuge in "an army which was not the army of freedom".

### Fugitive Slaves
*page 4*
- When it became clear that the Union armies would not return fugitives, slaves entered in a general strike.
- Ran away to safety and offered services to the Federal Army.
- Served the emancipating army.

### Southern Dependence on Slaves
*page 4*
- The South was heavily dependent on black slaves to raqise food and money for civillians and the army.
  - The South ignored the idea that slaves would want to be rescued.
  - Convinced the slaves did not want tob e free.
- South made a careful calculation of military value of slaves.
  - Slaves would run throughout the war.
  - In the industrial North, the men fighting would be workers and laborers that ran it.
  - The institution of slavery was a strong economic weapon.

#### Military Usage
*page 5*
- The South considered using slaves as military labor.
  - Would throw up breastworks, transport and prepare food, act as servants.
  - Authorized slaves to work on military construction.
  - Texas: 1,000 slaves offerred by planters to work on public defenses.
  - Pondering military use as soldiers.
- *Slavery softened as the war proceeded.*
  - Some level of harshness had to disappear; women and children were mainly left.
  - **The condition of the slave had changed**, no matter who won the war.
- The South needed to be careful; assured them of the bad character of the North.

### Questioning that the Northernors were Abolitionists
*page 6*
- War was about to happen; slaves began to sense it and large numbers of fugitive salves & free blacks rushed to the North.
- When Northern officials arrived in war, they made sure not to touch slavery.
  - W.T. Sherman in October 1861: was polite and said he had no idea of interfering with slaves.
  - Major Generasl Dix: was careful in seizure of two counties in Virginia not to touch slaves.
  - Burnside: returned two slaves that had tried to run away from them.
    - May have been salves.
  - July 4th, Colonel Pryor of Ohio: repudiated that the Northern army were abolitionists.
- Southern newspapers argued that the war was over abolition; Northeners denied this.
  - Some even promised to put down slave insurrections "with an iron hand".
  - Some took measures to send fugitives back.
- In the North, blacks were not allowed to enlist.
```
[The Civil War was begun]... in the interests of slavery on both sides.
The South was fighting to take slavery out of the Union,
and the North fighting to keep it in the Union;
the South fighting tog et it beyond the limits of the United State Constitution,
and the North fighting for the old guarantees;
- both despising the Negro,
but insulting the Negro.
- Frederick Douglass, Boston 1865
```

### What the Civil War Was to Slaves
#### Southern Propaganda
*page 8*
- It was not clear to most of the slaves what the war meant.
  - Spread propaganda: the Northeners would sell the slaves into worse slavery of the West Indies.
  - Would drive slaves from plantations into highways and danger.
- The South spread propaganda and pointed to how badly fugitive slaves lived.
  - Spread stories of Northernors taking women away forcefully.

#### A Stream of Fugitive Slaves
*page 9*
- As long as the Union stood still, the slave worked; when the Union army moved into slave territory, the slave joined it.
- Fugitive slaves: had been running to the North and onwards to Canada.
  - Kept down the chanc of insurrection.
  - The chhance to run away increased, there was encouragement.
- The Union did not propose to fight for slaves or to touch slavery; yet faced a stampede of fugitive slaves.
- Tried to send the slaves back; marker of a "dress parade war" (fancily and status-driven constructions of etiquette).
  - When it became a real war, slaves were captured or recieved, used as laborers & servants for the Northern army.
- **Southern worker held the key to the war.**
  - The black worker raised food and raw materials in a more strategic place than the white worker.
- When Fremont in Missouri freed slaves, Lincoln repudiated what he had done.
  - General Butler: kept fugitives and freed them letting them to do whatever work they could.
- Slaves were being used for military purposes by the North.
- A flood of fugitives arrived; a slave population pushed its way towards Northern troops.
  - Sometimes encountered worse treatment, but still stuck given that their interests were identical.
  - Included a few poorerw hties as well.
- Movement became a general strike against the slave system for all that could find oppurtunity.
- A swarming and increasing population of slaves refused to work on Confederate plantations and sought freedom in the Northern armies.
  - Treatment of slaves generally left at the discretion of department managers.
- Eventually, fugitives organized and became laborers, servants, and spies.

#### Southern Denialism
*page 12*
- South prided itself on absence of slave violence.
- However, this was not true; hundreds of thousands of slaves were leaving masters.
  - Found an easier and decent way to freedom.

### To Slaves as Militant Laborers
*page 13*
- Using fugitive slaves as soldiers to replace tired and rebellious white Northerners.
  - Premise: the fugitive slave must have been fre.
- The North began with the idea of fighting a war *without touching slavery*.
  - Futigive slaves were eventually considered to be "contraband of war", a step to attract and introduce fugitive slave labor to assist Northern armies.
- Eventually, became military laborers and plantation laborers to support the Federal army.
- The North found itself freeing slaves hwen it had no intention of doing so.
  - Rise of "Department[s] of Negro Affairs".

#### Motivations for the Transition
*page 14*
- The Northern army with refugees is important but understudied.
- It is not enough to say that "black slaves were tired of work and wanted to live at the expense of the government".
- Contradiction: movement and suffering of the refugees, were better off on plantations than trailing an army.
  - Were mistreated, ridiculed, and driven away.
- It was a strike against not *work* but the *conditions of work*.
- Wanted to stop the plantation system economy, so they left the plantations.
- Black slaves found work they were willing to do in the North.
  - Wanted land and to see and own the results of their labor.
- When conditions of *honesty in treatment and education* were fulfilled, the result was phenomenal.

## Systematic Organizing of Slaves
### Butler and the New Orleans Sugar Plantations
*page 15*
- Greatest and most systematic organizing of fugitives - New Orleans.
  - Butler issued orders that no slave would be received in New Orleans.
  - Planters were unable to make slaves work; sent them back to the Federal lands.
  - Butler emancipated these slaves[^1]; seized abandoned sugar plantations and worked them with slave labor for the benefit of the government.
- With permission from the War Department and authority of the Confiscation Act;
  - Butler organized colonies of fugitives and regulated employment.
  - Black slaves were *willing to do the work* on the very same Southern plantations, but for the North.
- Maintained a black regimnet and kept black officers.
> "the colored people of Louisiana under the proper sense of the good you have done to the African race in the United States, beg leave to express you their gratitude."

### Systems for Caring for Slaves
- Butler and General Banks[^2] provided thousands of freedmen with medicine, rations, and clothing.

#### Failing Systems and Justification Based on Conditions of Work
- On January 30th, 1863, General Banks made labor on public works compulsory for blacks.
- The plan failed; blacks refused to work.
  - They were not *against work*, but *against conditions of work*.
- Fixed this mistake: selected blacks to look into conditions and report what was needed, etc.
- When respect was given, the experiment ran itself.

#### General Grant's System
- In Mississippi; many slaves had arrived from surrounding country.
  - Begged for protection and needed food, clothing, and shelter.
- A few were employed as servants, cooks, and scouts.
  - Majority were left to freeze adn starve.
- Grant determined that blacks would perform camp duties done normally by soldiers.
- Grant: selected John Eaton as head of Dep. of Negro Affairs.
  - Was appalled at the scenes at the camps.
- White sodliers were[^3] unwilling to serve black fugitive slaves.
- Economic basis in which work of relief can be placed:
  - Fugitives were willing to go to work haqrvesting ungathered corn and cotton that could be sold.
  - Eaton fixed wages and kept accounts for workers.
- The freedmen became self-sustaining and gave little trouble.
  - Constructed cabins for themselves.
- Were perfectly willing to have a *tax on their wages* to support the sick and dependant.

#### Blacks Buying Land
*page 19*
- In particular cases, blacks were *encouraged* to buy land.
  - Building cabins and forming settlements was encouraged; a system of education was established.
- Refugees were grouped into villages; their work was systemized.
- Blacks saved up money from the sale of pigs, chickens, and eggs (and other work) to buy a tract of land.
- Under General Saxton in South Carolina, blacks began to buy land sold for non-payment of taxes.
  - Immensely productive in terms of cotton output. Lower cost.
  
#### Sherman and the Sea Island Circular
*page 20*
- Land and labor control were successful; a flood of refugees emerged from previously ontouched lands.
- Sherman's march to the sea cut the Cotton Kingdom in two.
- Sherman issued the Sea Island Circular in Jan. 18, 1865.
  - Islands from southern Charleston were reserved as a settlement for blacks.
  - A great success; worked with energy and diligence.

### Implications of Such Systems
*page 22*
- Blacks worked fewer hours and had more time for self-expression as a result.
  - Exports were fewer than during slavery.
  - Emancipation enlarged the black person's purchasing power; *producing to consume*.
- Freedmen were further organized for cotton raising.

#### The Importance of Conditions of Work
*page 24*
- Efficiency as free laborers dependent on the conditions in which they labored under.
- Dishonesty and indolence were the *creation fo slavery* and not "faults of the negro Character."

## Formation of Organizations and Commissions
*page 24*
- To aid the government came religious and benevolent organizations.

### THe American Missionary Association and Religion\
*page 24*
- The AMA grew out of defense for black slaves; captured the slave ship *Amistad* in 1837.
- Extended work in 1862-1863, establishing missions along the Atlantic Coast.
- Churches and missionary societies responded to the reports of Pierce, Dupont, and Sherman.
- Scope of work enlarged by the arrival of *white* refugees.
  - A portal through which poor whites and blacks were sent to loyal states for homes and employment.

### Educational Commissions
*page 25*
- Educational organization in Bosto, suggested by reports of Pierce.
  - New England aFreedman's Aid Society; worked in all Southern States.
- National Freedmens' Relief Association in NYC, broadened towards the whole South.
- Port Royal Relief Committee in Philadelphia, etc. expanded quickly.

### Abuses of Commissions
*page 26*
- President Yeatman of the Western Sanitary Commission in 1863; visited freedmen in Mississippi Valley.
- Saw abuses of the leasing system.
  - Suggested a plan to organize free labor and leasing plantations.
- Bureau to take charge of leasing land and to secure justice and freedom to fo freedmen.
  - Was adopted and satisfactory.
- Confusion and lack of system were natural results of the general strike.
  - Accomplished first aim; escaped plantation discipline, were recieving wages, and had protection from violence and justice[^4] in the courts.

## Redefinition of the Objectives of the North in War
*page 26*
- The South woke up to the fact that the war would be very long.
- The North realized what war meant in blood and money.
  - The relationship between the North and the black person changed.
- Free blacks of the North were clamoring; a war against the South was a war against slavery.
- Abolitionists no longer needed to fear the mob; leaders of church and state talked of freedom.
  - The black person was valuable labor initially, as a key to Southern resistance.
  - Became military power: without them, Lincoln says, the North would not have won the war.
- Slow changing of perceptions of the slave were not only a matter of soldiers.
  - Without the labor of the slaves the South would starve.

### Impact on Strategies of the South
*Page 27*
- Action of slaves impacted poor whites.
  - So long as the planters' war seemed successful, seemed to be little opposition.
  - When conscription and other burdens were placed, there was increasing opposition.
- Racism was developed to pit white mechanics with the planters against slaves and the North.
  - Racial basis emphasized to harden the line between black and white.
- Even the race argument could not hide that rich Southernors were not fighting in the war.
  - Desperately, arguments were made that the poor white would benefit the most from protecting slavery.
- Poor whites were losing faith; saw poverty was fighting the war, not wealth.
  - Combination of fear and jealousy of blacks as much as disaffection with slaveowners.
  - Economic rivalry with blacks arose.

### Lincoln and Centering Slaves in the War
*page 29*
- Lincoln began to see that the war was centering around slaves.
- Talked about compensation for emancipated slaves, passed the Confiscation Act in August 1861.
  - Freed slaves used in war by the enemy.
- Lincoln suggests provision made for colonization fo salves.
  - Could not envision free blakcs in the United States.
  - If Lincoln could hold the country together and keep slavery, he would do it.
- August, Lincoln faced the truth; blacks not only ought to be free, but thousands of them were already free.
  - Either the black man would be allowed to fight, or the draft would not bring enough white men.
- North faced the moral strength of declaring that they were fighting for the emancipation of slaves.
  - Lincoln declared that the slaves of all persons in rebellion were "henceforward and forever free".

## Conclusion
- The fugitive slaves, fugitives as "contrabands", spies, serants and laborers; the black persona s a soldier, citizen, then voter.
  - Steps were an almost rhythmic drumbeat.
- Price of disaster of war; a price few Americans initially dreamed of paying.
- North was not abolitionist; but as abolitionist-democracy gained in power, they guided the nation out of moral failure.
