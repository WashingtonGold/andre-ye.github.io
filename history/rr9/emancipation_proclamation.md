## Context
The Emancipation Proclamation, issued on September 22nd, 1862, by President Lincoln.
> During the course of the Civil War, Lincoln had wanted to declare all slaves free. He waited, however, until the Union forces had some decisive victories over the Rebels; no doubt his holding off was to prevent giving the South a rallying point until one would have no effect on the outcome of the war. After the Southern defeat at Antietam, he felt the time was right. He announced that in 100 days, on January 1, 1863, he would issue an order freeing the slaves in the states in rebellion.
> The reason that Lincoln restricted the Proclamation to those states active in the rebellion is that Lincoln felt he could take such unilateral action in those states not currently recognizing the authority of the Union; the loyal Union states had certain rights that a Presidential Proclamation would have no Constitutional power over.
> The effect was to embolden the South, with an "I told you so" sort of pride - they could say that the President had always intended to take away their right to their slaves. They also saw it as a call for a slave rebellion within the Confederate borders. However, it also had the effect of causing European powers from backing off their already wavering support of the Confederacy, lest they be seen as supporting slavery.
> Unfortunately, the Proclamation also made the war less popular in the North; the war now seemed to be over the freeing of slaves (something many Northerners were not particularly keen on, despite the general Northern propensity towards abolition) and not about the need to keep the Union together. The war ended two and a half years later.
