  Thesis: All-encompassing fear – not only from a fear of slaves but from every direction – natives, indentured servants, limitations to legislative action from both from within and outside the gentry – drove the development of racism and racialized chattel slavery. Towards the end of the 1700s and early 1800s, racialized chattel slavery was not driven by economics, but by fear. Building upon conflicts and ideas that stemmed from capitalism in England, the initial hostility between the elite and the working-class – specifically, the elite’s opinions on how to extract more profit from a working-class they saw as idle and lazy – was set up. However, as capitalism drove the numbers against the gentry, demonstrated by Bacon’s Rebellion, the elite chose to develop racism as a social tool out of fear of retaliation from the natives and fear from a working-class riot. When the slave population continued to amass and incidents like the Stono rebellion, the gentry attempted to regulate the slave trade with Britain but was undercut by poorer and younger members who still purchased slaves. With the fear of another slave riot and with the limitation of not being able to completely halt the slave trade, the gentry resorted to outright racial violence, more as an ideology than a coordinated effort to extract economic value from slaves. Furthermore, this transition of conflicts in slavery from being inherently capitalistic to being completely motivated by fear from a variety of sources – the natives, white indentured servants rioting and seizing control, a deadly slave insurrection, among legislative limitations both from within and from Parliament – better explains American racism’s persistence past slavery as economic practice.
